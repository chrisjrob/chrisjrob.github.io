I went to look for an article on fcheck, that I originally found on
<http://debaday.debian.net>, only to find the site down, there is 
[a related bug](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=543343 "Debian Bug 543343"),
but no news on where it has gone nor why.  The debaday service was
fantastic for finding out about useful packages, in fact that was how I
learned about fcheck.

Then I ended up at <http://news.debian.net/>, and what do I see but:

No explanation, just that.  If it was coming back soon, one would have
expected the announcement to state that, so the assumption has to be
that these valuable services have both come to an end.

This makes me sad.  The answer is for the community to leap in, and I
hope this time that the work can be distributed; so that it is not
reliant on any one person.
