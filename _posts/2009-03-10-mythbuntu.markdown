Initial impressions [weren't that great]({% post_url 2009-03-01-mythbuntu %}), but I have to say that mythtv is winning us over.  The turning point was when we switched on mythweb.  Mythweb does several things, but most notably it provides the program listings in a much more usable format than via mythtv  This makes it must easier to browse and search the listings and record programs.  And with a little extra work, it should be possible to make this accessible over the web.  This feature gained huge spouse approval.

The other win is the commercial skipping, enabling a one button press to skip adverts.

Please see my [later post on MythWeb]({% post_url 2009-03-14-mythweb %}).
