<p>Further to <a title="Barclays on-line banking" href="2011/02/23/barclays-on-line-banking/">my recent post</a> on the subject, I have now found <a title="Barclays Corporate Internet Security" href="http://www.business.barclays.co.uk/BRC1/jsp/brccontrol?task=homefreevi8&amp;value=10335&amp;target=_blank&amp;site=bbb">more information</a> on the Barclays Corporate website:</p>
<blockquote><p>To access Business Internet Banking you need four things present at the same time:</p>
<ol>
<li>A PC or laptop with the software that runs the smart card reader installed</li>
<li>A smart card reader. This is a hardware device, attached to your PC that the smart card is inserted into</li>
<li>A smart card unique to each individual user. The card will become “locked” if an invalid PIN is entered in excess of a pre defined number of times</li>
<li>A PIN unique to each individual user.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately the <a title="Barclays Software Requirements" href="http://www.business.barclays.co.uk/BRC1/jsp/brccontrol?task=popup1vi8&amp;value=13114&amp;target=_blank&amp;site=bbb">Software Requirements link</a>, at the bottom of that page, states only that you need Adobe Acrobat Reader, which I suspect is not the only software requirement!</p>
<p>The Barclays Personal On-line banking works with all the browsers, so if the same is true of the Corporate banking, then it is at least possible that I could install Firefox under Wine on Linux, providing only that I can get the smart card reader to work.</p>
<p>The difficulty would be if it needs Active-X support, which whilst <a title="WineHQ Change Log" href="http://www.winehq.org/news/2010121001">theoretically supported under the latest versions of Wine</a>, would make the proposition very much less likely to work.</p>
