<p>Our built-in De-Dietrich microwave over has been broken for weeks. Initially the door catch had broken, but a replacement catch DIY-fitted had not fixed the problem.</p>
<p>De-Dietrich's service agent wanted £195 to come out and fix the oven - a ludicrous price for a 13 year old microwave. Other appliance repair centres would either not repair microwave ovens at all, or particularly excluded De-Dietrich.</p>
<p>Fortunately one such appliance repair person recommended that we contact <a title="Visual Eyes" href="http://www.visual-eyes.eu/Pages/CommercialMicrowaveRepairs.aspx">Visual Eyes in Farnham, Surrey</a>. We did so, and the next day a nice man came and fixed our oven for £40.</p>
<p>Great service, thank you Visual Eyes.</p>
