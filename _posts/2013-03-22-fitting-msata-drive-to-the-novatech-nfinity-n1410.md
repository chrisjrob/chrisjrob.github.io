As discussed in my earlier [The Novatech nFinity n1410
Review](http://chrisjrob.com/2013/02/22/the-novatech-nfinity-n1410-review/ "The Novatech nFinity n1410 Review"),
I made a mistake in sticking with the default 128gb SSD. I promised to
write up how I carried upgraded my Ultrabook by adding an mSATA drive,
but time has passed and I failed to take any notes.

The drive I ordered was a [Crucial CT256M4SSD3 256GB m4 mSATA 6Gb/s
Internal
SSD](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0085J17UA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B0085J17UA&linkCode=as2&tag=robsquadnet-21 "Crucial CT256M4SSD3 256GB M4 SATA III 6Gb/s mSATA MLC Internal SSD").

The installation was not difficult, and to the best of my recollection
followed these steps:

1.  Undo screws on bottom;
2.  Use knife to gently release the catches around the keyboard;
3.  Carefully remove keyboard;
4.  I seem to recall that there were additional screws behind the
    keyboard, which need to be removed;
5.  Fit mSATA drive, fixing with screw supplied with the drive;
6.  Close case.

Apologies that these instructions are so poor, but hopefully the
photographs in the [Picasaweb album
opposite](https://picasaweb.google.com/112653355770650909703/NovatechNFinityN1410?authuser=0&amp;feat=embedwebsite)
will help.
