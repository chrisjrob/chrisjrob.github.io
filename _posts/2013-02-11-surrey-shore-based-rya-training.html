<p>I was delighted to find <a href="http://www.surrey-shorebased.co.uk" title="Surrey Shore-based RYA Training">this local RYA training centre</a>. Operated from Phil's back garden, you expect the worst, but actually the facilities are excellent, with a proper classroom with tables, projector, VHFs, tea and coffee etc.</p>
<p>I recently had my Marine VHF training there and I thought the course was excellent and I plan to go on to do my Day Skipper training at a later date.</p>
