<p><a title="iRedMail - Open Source Mailserver" href="http://iredmail.org/">iRedMail - Open Source Mailserver</a></p>
<p>Whilst the world seems to be moving email to "The Cloud", rightly or wrongly I remain reluctant to give up the control of our own mailserver. For over ten years now we have been using a combination of the following open source applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Postfix MTA with Amavis + Spamassassin</li>
<li>Dovecot IMAP server</li>
<li>OpenLDAP</li>
</ul>
<p>Whilst these are super-stable and bulletproof solutions, the&nbsp;main issue with such a solution is the administration - setting up users, changing passwords, vacation notifications, sieve etc. It is also a lonely business administering a custom mailserver, where set-up is never going to be completely standard.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>A couple of years ago I migrated to a new mailserver, on which I installed <a title="iRedMail" href="http://iredmail.org/">iRedMail</a>. iRedMail is a pre-packaged mailserver solution, based on all the software that I was using already (Postfix, Dovecot, OpenLDAP), but with the benefit of a slick admin panel&nbsp;that pulls it all together and provides ongoing support. It also incorporates Roundcube for webmail, undoubtedly prettier than Squirrelmail, which we were using before.&nbsp;iRedMail even includes a pre-configure Fail2ban, essential to protect your internet-facing server from attack.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="665"]<a href="http://www.iredmail.org/images/iredadmin/"><img class=" " alt="The iRedAdmin Dashboard" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dashboard.png" width="665" height="343" /></a> The iRedAdmin Dashboard[/caption]</p>
<p>There are two web administration panels to choose from - the free and open source panel and the Pro panel. Both interfaces are attractive and functional, but predictably the Pro panel has more functionality <a title="iRedMail pricing" href="http://iredmail.org/pricing.html">at a price</a>. Some would call this Crippleware, but bear in mind that the server itself has full functionality - this is merely the configuration of that server. If you are happy to configure LDAP yourself, then you don't strictly need to use the Pro panel.&nbsp;See <em>"Features and Comparison"</em> half way down <a title="Features of iRedAdmin" href="http://iredmail.org/admin_panel.html">this page</a>.&nbsp;Whilst the Pro panel does come with the source code, the developer explicitly restricts your right to distribute.</p>
<p>Installation is very fast - but must be on a fresh server - I tried to upgrade from an existing Postfix install and it ended badly.&nbsp;Updates are delivered as a web page of instructions, which I have come to prefer to running an upgrade script, as you can intelligently decide whether you are happy with each change proposed. The downside is that you could easily miss a step and leave your server only partially "upgraded".</p>
<p>Whilst the forums are quiet, the developer is very responsive to posts and has dealt efficiently which each issue that I encountered.&nbsp;Roundcube has proven to be a very attractive webmail interface and includes Sieve administration for server-based filtering and vacation notices.</p>
<p>Overall we are very happy iRedMail users - if there is an easier way of running an Open Source mailserver, I have not discovered it.</p>
