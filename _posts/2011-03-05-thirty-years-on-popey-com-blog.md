[Apparently the ZX81 is 30 years' old](http://popey.com/blog/2011/03/05/thirty-years-on/), wow.  
[The wedge-shaped box](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81 "Read about the ZX81 on Wikipedia")
that started my interest in computers, and led inexorably to my love of
Linux and tinkering with the command-line.

Popey clearly has a better memory than I, but I do remember rushing up
to my bedroom with
[ZX81](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81 "Read about the ZX81 on Wikipedia")
in hand, plugging it all in and then at the prompt typing "hello". I was
very disappointed that the computer seemed to have no ability to talk
back! But once I got passed that disappointment, I fell in love with the
thing. I didn’t do much programming on it, but I used to get the
computer magazines and type in the assembly code in order to play games.
There was an [awesome dinosaur game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_Monster_Maze) I remember.

I was fortunate enough to be able to have the 
[ZX Spectrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum "Read about the ZX Spectrum on Wikipedia")
when it came out and was blown away by how much better it was than the
ZX81. I remember the games with such fondness, but sadly many of them
are still available on the net – and they’re actually a bit crap – but
at the time they seemed absolutely incredible. I spent many a happy hour
with [Jetpack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jetpac). But the main memory
I have is anxiously waiting whilst the games retrieved from the audio
cassettes – would it load? Can you imagine a storage technology that was
so slow and only worked 2 in every 3 times – laughable really.
