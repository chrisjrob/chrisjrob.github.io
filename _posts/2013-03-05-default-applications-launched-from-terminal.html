<p>For some time it has irritated me that launching URLs from my terminal would always launch Iceweasel/Firefox, rather than my default browser Chromium. If you're running KDE or Gnome, then I accept that this would be governed from somewhere in the desktop environment's control panel or settings, but I run <a title="PekWM" href="http://www.pekwm.org">PekWM</a>, and assumed that setting the default browser in update-alternatives should be enough:</p>
<pre># update-alternatives --config x-www-browser</pre>
<p>Unfortunately of course many of the applications that I am using are native to KDE or Gnome and probably are still respecting their environment's settings. In the end it was simply a case of editing:</p>
<pre>~/.local/share/applications/defaults.list</pre>
<p>And adding the following lines:</p>
<pre>x-scheme-handler/http=chromium.desktop
x-scheme-handler/https=chromium.desktop</pre>
<p>Now opening links from my terminal is correctly opening a new tab in Chromium, or running Chromium if it isn't already.</p>
<p>Joy.</p>
