[![3D Print: Curtain
Hook]({{%20site.baseurl%20}}/assets/dscf1652.jpg)](http://www.fabfabbers.com/models/id/166/curtainhook-by-chrisjrob)

My mother-in-law's curtains were pulled down by a Great Dane, breaking
many of the curtain hooks. They seemed to be an unusual design and she
asked if I might be able to print them on my RepRap.

This was very satisfying design, which did not take long, posed no
particular challenges and printed very quickly. If only all jobs were
like that.
