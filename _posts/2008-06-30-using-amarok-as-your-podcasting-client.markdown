Until I stumbled across [this page][howto] I was using [Kitty] to download Podcasts and [Amarok] to manage them thereafter.  Unfortunately I could not get on with Kitty and it is no longer being developed.  In any case, you really only want one application.

So I went hunting for an alternative to Amarok that would handle Podcasts, only to discover that Amarok itself supports Podcasts.  Basically all you need to do is under Playlists >> Podcasts right-click and Add Podcast, but [this link][howto] explains in more detail.

In every other respect Amarok was perfect, so I could not be more delighted.  Well done [Amarok]!
