Apparently [it was a 24 hour experiment]({% post_url 2010-06-10-google-you-plonkers %}), but Google saw sense and ended it 10 hours early, after the twitterverse went beserk.

Now those that want pictures of kittens as their background can and the rest of us can keep our plain simple and fast search page.  After spending the day using [ixquick](http://ixquick.com), I'll be glad to return to google.com, which is still the best search engine that I have ever used.

When are we going to see a decent open source search engine, maybe distributed in some way amongst its user base?
