Yes once again I come to complete my tax return, last time it was [a far from successful experience]({% post_url 2009-01-11-uk-self-assessment-for-linux %}).

Given that that page is now a year old and my next year's return is required, I thought it was an opportune time to update it.  Unfortunately nothing much has changed, the list of personal tax applications has shrunk, as TaxCalc's market domination continues.  The only Linux-compatible competitor seems to still be ftax and it requires Acrobat Reader, which isn't available for 64-bit Linux.

The problem is that you don't really want to mess about with your personal tax, especially when that includes on-line submission.  You need to have faith in the company that offers the product, and you need them to have sufficient numbers of customers that, if there is a problem, it gets fixed quickly.

In short, the only meaninful competition for TaxCalc would seem to be HMRC's own web-based offering.  If it weren't for my positive experiences in using TaxCalc, the convenience of being able to import the previous year's return, and the fact that I have a Windows virtual-machine on my laptop, I would probably try out the HMRC system.  As it is, sadly, the Windows-only TaxCalc wins again.
