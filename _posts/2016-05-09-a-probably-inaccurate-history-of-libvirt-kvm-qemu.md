A while ago I was explaining the difference between QEMU, KVM and LibVirt, 
and I ended up by emailing this nonsense.
I don't claim it's accurate, it certainly isn't.
It's probably not even funny.
Enjoy :).

*In the beginning there was QEMU, but it was slow and the people grieved.*
<!--more-->

*Then KVM was forked from QEMU with a kernel module to use the CPU's
virtualisation features to work much faster and there was much
rejoicing. Linus also rejoiced and welcomed KVM's kernel module into
the mainline kernel.*

*But the people did not rejoice, as they were mostly using Sun's
VirtualBox (also forked from QEMU).*

*QEMU awoke from its slumber and joined with KVM and their union caused
almost no rejoicing, in fact I am not convinced anyone really noticed.*

*But the System Administrators were still dissatisfied and complained
that there should be standardisation of commands across different
hypervisors. And thus LibVirt was born and the System Administrators
rejoiced.*

*Yet still the people used VirtualBox. But lo! The evil Oracle slew the
Sun and VirtualBox moved into darkness, and there was much gnashing of
teeth and wearing of sackcloth; although this was generally considered
a step forwards from the t-shirts that they usually wore.*

*But still the people could not use QEMU-KVM, without issuing complex
incantations, and so Virt-Manager was born and finally the people
rejoiced, with much clicking of mice.*

The End.
