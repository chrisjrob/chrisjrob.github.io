<p>Following <a href="/2011/03/03/problems-playing-silverlight-media-on-windows-server-2003/">my recent post</a> regarding Silverlight, unfortunately I have hit disaster. &nbsp;When the audio starts, it sounds choppy with a double-echo or reverb. &nbsp;In short it is unusable. &nbsp;All other audio works fine, even on the same webpage, but as soon as you try and listen to a Silverlight widget it sounds terrible.</p>
<p>Googling "silverlight rdp choppy" in desperation has not filled me with confidence, there are a number of posts including:<!--more--></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://forums.silverlight.net/forums/p/94280/303052.aspx">Has anyone else ran into a problem where if you use a Silverlight app over Remote Desktop and it plays a WMA or MP3 file using MediaElement, the sound is choppy?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible that upgrading to Windows Server 2008 would resolve this issue; although there are issues I believe in connecting to the latest RDP version using rdesktop.</p>
<p>I did find <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/winserverhyperv/thread/1e7a9764-e220-4693-a4ac-d7f4e811283b">this advice from Microsoft</a>, the Microsoft RDP Client was the only sound card available, but I followed the advice anyway to no avail.</p>
<p>What I simply do not understand is why all other audio works perfectly via RDP, except Silverlight, especially given the fact that Silverlight and RDP are Microsoft products.</p>
<p>Any suggestions gratefully received!</p>
