[Surrey Shore-based RYA
Training](http://www.surrey-shorebased.co.uk "Surrey Shore-based RYA Training")

I was delighted to find [this local RYA training
centre](http://www.surrey-shorebased.co.uk "Surrey Shore-based RYA Training").
Operated from Phil's back garden, you expect the worst, but actually the
facilities are excellent, with a proper classroom with tables,
projector, VHFs, tea and coffee etc.

I recently had my Marine VHF training there and I thought the course was
excellent and I plan to go on to do my Day Skipper training at a later
date.
