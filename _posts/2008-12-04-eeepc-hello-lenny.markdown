I guess the logical replacement distro to install on an eepc, is the [Ubuntu EeePC](http://www.ubuntu-eee.com/) remix.  To be quite honest I think you have to have a pretty compelling reason to go anywhere else.  My compelling reasons were that I just wanted a standard distro, that I know well and can look after without having to learn new skills; as a KDE user I ideally wanted access to KDE apps.  It really was always going to be [Debian Lenny EeePC](http://wiki.debian.org/DebianEeePC).

The [installation instructions](http://wiki.debian.org/DebianEeePC/HowTo/Install) were an absolute doddle, which really don't require any help from me.  I installed KDE, expecting it to be a bit sluggish, but the great surprise is that it is really fast.

All in all a really good experience and it really is lovely to be typing this on my Debian Lenny EeePC.

Thank you Debian.
