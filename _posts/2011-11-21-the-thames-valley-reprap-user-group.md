I was surprised to realise that I have not yet blogged about my latest
project - building a Reprap 3D Printer.

I have been following the [Reprap project](http://reprap.org "Reprap")
for some time, but it always seemed to me to require hardware hacking
skills that were that little bit beyond me.

At [Oggcamp 2011](http://oggcamp.org "Oggcamp") I watched 
[a presentation by Malcolm Napier](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiMC39iLsQY "Oggcamp 2011 Reprap Presentation by Malcolm Napier")
of [empirical](http://www.e-mpirical.com/ "empirical") on the Reprap
project.  Whilst this sparked my interest anew, I was put off by
Malcolm's mention of builds taking months rather than days; as before
this seemed to be a project for hardware hackers.

A few weeks later I received an email from 
[Hugo Mills](http://carfax.org.uk/ "Hugo Mills") asking me to post an
invitation to a new Reprap build event to the 
[Surrey Linux User Group](http://surrey.lug.org.uk "Surrey Linux User Group") mailing list.
The build event was being organised by Malcolm, and would help users to
build their own Reprap in a supported way. This sounded perfect for me
so, having forwarded the email, I booked a place on the build event.

To cut an unnecessarily long story short - I have now ordered and paid
for my reprap parts and am now eagerly awaiting their arrival. There are
20 of us in the first build project and we are hoping to receive
everything except the electronics by the end of November.  The
expectation is that we will complete the build in January.

If you would like to read more, and perhaps consider participating in a
second build project, then visit [the very new TVRRUG website](http://tvrrug.org.uk "Thames Valley Reprap User Group"), and
perhaps start off by reading the [First Steps page](http://tvrrug.org.uk/first-steps "TVRRUG: First Steps").

I will try and blog about the experience here, in the meantime we have a
fairly active IRC Channel #tvrrug on Freenode if you would like to pop
in for a chat.
