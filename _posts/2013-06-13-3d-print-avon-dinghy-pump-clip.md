Having bought an inflatable Avon Redcrest dinghy on eBay, I found that
the pump no longer had a clip holding the two halves together. I knew
that the older models used to have a piece of leather attached to one
half with holes that clipped over screws on the other half, but on this
pump only the screws remained.

<!--more-->

Newer pumps instead came with a plastic clip that attached to the pump
hose and clamped the two halves together and I felt that it would be
quite simple to replicate and so it proved. This was a simple design
exercise and worked perfectly first time. I have since re-sold the
dinghy and hope that the pump clip is still serving its new owner.
