Having been quoted £250 to replace the halyards and topping lift on my
boat, I decided to do it myself, by purchasing the ropes from eBay for
£100 and the fids to do the splicing for £33.

Having the fids would then enable me to do the rest of the running
rigging: reefing pennants, kicking strap etc.

The only trouble was that I didn't know how to splice braid-on-braid,
and it turned out to be more tricky than I expected. In the end I found
a [YouTube video](http://youtu.be/Ym1-rI0SdaA) to help me.
