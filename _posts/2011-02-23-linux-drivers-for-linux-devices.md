Nothing annoys me more than this - companies that use the Linux
operating system for their devices, but who don't provide a driver for
Linux clients to access the same devices.  For example
[Garmin](https://buy.garmin.com/support/searchSupport/case.faces?caseId={85786160-026e-11dd-dc9c-000000000000} "Garmin Linux Support"),
[Tom Tom](http://www.tomtom.com/ "Tom Tom") and [Road
Angel](http://www.road-angel-gps.co.uk/ "Road Angel") to name but three
that have effected me personally.  I know that the counter argument is
that we want Linux to be used by these companies, and I appreciate that
they may well be  contributing in other ways, but this still upsets me.

My gripe is this - that these companies are taking the produce of the
work done by Linux developers to make new products and thus generate
profits, and then not allowing those same Linux developers to access
those newly developed devices.  Worse, some of these companies are now
[starting to support Apple Mac OS/X](http://garmin.blogs.com/my_weblog/2010/02/ask-garmin-can-i-use-garmin-connect-if-im-on-a-mac.html "Garmin support Mac OS/X"),
but not bothering to support Linux, the very operating system that gave
birth to their product.

And the daft thing is that in many cases [they don't even need to do the
work themselves](http://www.linuxdriverproject.org/ "Linux Driver Project").
