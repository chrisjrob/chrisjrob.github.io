My Westerly sailing boat has a rectangular-shaped shorepower socket and
the faceplate was broken in half. Given its very exposed position in the
cockpit, this is only to be expected, but purchasing a replacement
proved very difficult. Fortunately the broken half had been kept by the
previous owner, which enabled me to design an exact replica. And the
beauty is that it will certainly be broken again, so I have printed a
spare.
