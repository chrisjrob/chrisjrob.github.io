<p>I wanted to change my blog so that the home page only has an opening paragraph of each blog post, rather than having the full text.  In my opinion this makes the blog easier and more pleasant to navigate.  Unfortunately it seems that in trying to achieve this, I changed the RSS feed as well.</p>
<p>My apologies for this error, it wasn't deliberate and I do appreciate that it is more convenient to read the whole text from within your chosen RSS aggregator.  Although it was nice having the additional page views - twice as many today as yesterday...</p>
<p>I think I have corrected the problem, so we should be back to full text for this and all subsequent posts.  If not, let me know!</p>
