<p>I have looked into moving to Barclays on-line business banking, but apparently it requires a hardware card reader that only works on Windows and Mac. This is a major problem as we run Linux everywhere and only access Windows via RDP to a virtual server.</p>
<p>Currently we use Barclays BusinessMaster that is installed on a shared Windows server that we can access via RDP or ICA. Thus any user with a BusinessMaster login can update our bank, create payments etc (subject to authority levels of course!).</p>
<p>Our only option now seems to be to install a standalone Windows PC somewhere and physically have to visit it in order to do our business banking.</p>
<p>Welcome to 2011.</p>
