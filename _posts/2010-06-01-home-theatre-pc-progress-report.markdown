Spent some time setting up my wife's email on the new HTPC, using Kmail and disconnected IMAP.  Installed Google Chrome.  Added a KDE Plasmoid on the desktop for Facebook and Twitter, which hopefully my wife will like.  Other than that I have had no time to spend on the completing the MythTV installation.  More soon hopefully.
