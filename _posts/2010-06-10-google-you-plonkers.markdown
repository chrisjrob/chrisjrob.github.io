Why do we use Google?  Because it is lightweight and fast.  What could Google do to make themselves less appealing?  Well, I suppose they could add a desktop background that adds to the clutter of the page and requires everyone to download a pointless image, but they'd never do something that stupid, would they?

And they have.

I can only imagine Google are wanting to reduce their monopoly and increase competition in the search engine market, and perhaps that is to be applauded.

Okay, so what can I use instead of Google?  I think I'll try Bing, supposedly their privacy policy is better as well.
