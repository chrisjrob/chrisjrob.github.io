<p>I sometimes find myself wondering what a package's dependencies are.  This question is usually quickly satisfied with a <code>$ sudo apt-get install packagename</code> and then aborting, or perhaps more elegantly <code>$ sudo apt-get -s install packagename</code> to simulate the installation.</p>
<p>This doesn't give you the entire picture, as it only lists the dependencies that you don't already have; which is usually all you care about, but there are occasions when you would like to list all of a package's dependencies, for example when planning for a system that is not built yet, or not accessible at the current time.  Or just for idle curiosity!  Perhaps that's just me.<br />

Anyhow, apt-rdepends is the application for the job.  It doesn't just list the package's dependencies, but it recursively goes through each dependency's dependencies.</p>
<p>Install it with the usual <code>$ sudo apt-get install apt-rdepends</code> and then simply run with:<br />
<code><br />
$ apt-rdepends packagename | less<br />
</code></p>
<p>Yes, it is quite verbose, hence the "| less" - leave it out if you prefer, or use "| more" which is more likely to be installed on your system (tip: install "less" - less is better than more, if that makes any sense).</p>
<p>For example, I had just installed "flite" and was amazed at how functional it was.  I wondered to myself whether it was just a front-end to festival - but how to find out?<br />
<code><br />
$ apt-rdepends flite<br />
</code></p>
<p>Which comes back with no other speech synthesis engine (e.g. festival), so clearly flite is a speech synthesis engine in its own right.</p>
