<p>Three things I love about <a href="http://www.pekwm.org/" title="PekWM">pekwm</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Window grouping:</strong> I love the fact that you can middle click on a window's titlebar and drop it onto another window and the two windows join together - with the titlebar split in segments.  You can switch between the applications by clicking on the relevant part of the titlebar, or use the Windows key with TAB - so just as Alt+Tab switches between windows, Windows+Tab switches between the applications grouped inside the current window.</li>
<li><strong>Double-click to fill available space:</strong> I love the fact that you can open an application and just double-click on its titlebar to fill the available space.  This feels so intuitive and just so damned right, that I struggle to understand why it is not the standard behaviour in all window managers and desktop environments.</li>
<li><strong>Clicking on the desktop edge moves you to the next workspace:</strong> I've never really got on with multiple desktops/workspaces - it is difficult enough to keep track of multiple applications inside a single workspace, but pekwm has converted me.  I find it just so intuitive that, by clicking on the edge of the desktop, that it it progresses you to the next desktop.</li>
</ol>
<p>So what do <strong>you</strong> love about pekwm?</p>
