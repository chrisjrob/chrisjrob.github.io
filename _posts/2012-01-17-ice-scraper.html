<p>I was scraping the ice off my car yesterday and thought to myself that an ice-scraper was just the sort of thing that you ought to be able to print using a 3D printer.  Surprisingly though, I could not find a single ice-scraper on <a href="http://www.fabfabbers.com/models/id/152/icescraper-by-chrisjrob" title="View on FabFabbers">FabFabbers</a>!</p>
<p>This situation could not be allowed to continue a moment longer! 10 minutes later I had modelled a basic ice-scraper using <a href="http://www.openscad.org/" title="OpenSCAD">OpenSCAD</a>; although it was certainly no beauty.</p>
<p>60 minutes later and I had installed the <a href="https://github.com/elmom/MCAD" title="MCAD Library">MCAD library</a> and was using "boxes.scad" to make the ice-scraper a little more rounded.</p>
<p>The resulting <a href="http://www.fabfabbers.com/models/id/152/icescraper-by-chrisjrob" title="Ice-scraper">ice-scraper</a> will certainly not win any design awards, but it was a fun project and I now know about the <a href="https://github.com/elmom/MCAD" title="MCAD Library">MCAD library</a>, which will open a whole new world of functionality for me.</p>
<p>But the exciting thing for me is that a simple object like an ice-scraper can be designed in only a few minutes and, with a 3D printer, would be a reality only a short time later.</p>
