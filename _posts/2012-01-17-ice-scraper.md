I was scraping the ice off my car yesterday and thought to myself that
an ice-scraper was just the sort of thing that you ought to be able to
print using a 3D printer. Surprisingly though, I could not find a single
ice-scraper on Thingiverse.

This situation could not be allowed to continue a moment longer! 10
minutes later I had modelled a basic ice-scraper using
[OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/ "OpenSCAD"); although it was
certainly no beauty.

60 minutes later and I had installed the 
[MCAD library](https://github.com/elmom/MCAD "MCAD Library") and was using
"boxes.scad" to make the ice-scraper a little more rounded.

The resulting
[ice-scraper][icescraper]
will certainly not win any design awards, but it was a fun project and I
now know about the 
[MCAD library](https://github.com/elmom/MCAD "MCAD Library"), which will open
a whole new world of functionality for me.

But the exciting thing for me is that a simple object like an
ice-scraper can be designed in only a few minutes and, with a 3D
printer, would be a reality only a short time later.
