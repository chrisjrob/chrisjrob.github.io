![Is your prop left or right
handed?]({{%20site.baseurl%20}}/assets/dscf1895.jpg)

I was a bit surprised to be asked if my prop was left or right-handed.
Turns out that my boat is unusual in being left-handed, as the prop
spins anti-clockwise. This means that the prop-wash will make it easier
to moor starboard side-to, which is important when choosing a berth.
