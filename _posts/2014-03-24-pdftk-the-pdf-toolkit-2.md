[PDFTK - The PDF
Toolkit](http://www.pdflabs.com/docs/pdftk-cli-examples/ "PDFTK - The PDF Toolkit")

I have long been a keen user of pdftk, the PDF Toolkit, but am
frequently surprised when people have not heard of it. True, it is a
command line tool, but it is easy to incorporate into service menus,
scripts etc and doubtless there is a GUI front-end for it somewhere (in
fact there is one linked to from the above page).

Clearly a blog post is called for, but, whilst you wait for a post that
will never arrive, [here is a
link](http://www.pdflabs.com/docs/pdftk-cli-examples/ "PDFTK - The PDF Toolkit")
to some examples that should open your eyes to what is possible with
pdftk.

To get started on a Debian-based system:

    $ sudo apt-get install pdftk
    $ man pdftk

Enjoy.
