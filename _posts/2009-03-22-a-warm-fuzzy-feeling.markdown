I apologise in advance for this shameless piece of self-congratulation; but a while ago I wrote about how to Recover Data from a Hard Disk, and I published it also on my local [LUG's knowledgebase](http://surrey.lug.org.uk/kb/datarecovery).  I have just received an email to say that my instructions have enabled someone to recover two years' worth of lesson plans for a special-needs teacher.  So I must admit to feeling rather pleased with myself!
