Apparently I am not the only one that thinks that the Debian graphics
are appalling:

Debian did have a design contest of sorts, well a brief mailing list
thread that had the impossible task of voting the best out of just a
handful of rubbish themes.  Given the choices, personally I would have
opted for the upstream themes, or just to stick with the Debian Lenny
theme which was perfectly okay.

I do wonder how easy or difficult it is to submit themes - do you have
to be a Debian developer?  If so, then they should really think about
lowering the bar.  I'm sure that I could produce something better,
although [my last attempt](http://kde-look.org/content/search.php?user=chrisjrob&search=Search "chrisjrob @ kde-look")
does not appear to be getting widespread approval.

Anyhow, we don't love Debian for how pretty is looks - we can soon
change the theme if it bothers us.
