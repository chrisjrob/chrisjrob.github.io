<p>I thought that this <a title="Linux Terminal Command Reference" href="http://community.linuxmint.com/tutorial/view/244">Linux Terminal Command Reference</a> from the Mint community was excellent. Having learned them piecemeal over many years, I was almost resentful to see them all listed together. Linux shouldn't be easy, it should be knowledge painfully acquired through years of humiliation on IRC channels and mailing lists!</p>
