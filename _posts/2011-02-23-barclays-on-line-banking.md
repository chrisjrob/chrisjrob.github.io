I have looked into moving to Barclays on-line business banking, but
apparently it requires a hardware card reader that only works on Windows
and Mac. This is a major problem as we run Linux everywhere and only
access Windows via RDP to a virtual server.

<!--more-->

Currently we use Barclays BusinessMaster that is installed on a shared
Windows server that we can access via RDP or ICA. Thus any user with a
BusinessMaster login can update our bank, create payments etc (subject
to authority levels of course!).

Our only option now seems to be to install a standalone Windows PC
somewhere and physically have to visit it in order to do our business
banking.

Welcome to 2011.
