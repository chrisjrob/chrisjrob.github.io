In an effort to make my desktop a little more elegant, I have designed some new wallpapers for use with KDE on Debian.  They may be a little too bling for some of you, but I'm quite pleased with them.  All created using free software, in the form of The Gimp.  In the spirit of free software, I have uploaded to [KDE Look](http://kde-look.org/usermanager/search.php?username=chrisjrob&action=contents) under a Creative Commons licence.
