Turnbuckle Boot Cap[/caption]

I realise that I have made a number of posts on Google+, without posting
first on my blog. This is the first of several posts that I will be
making to correct that oversight...

Sailing boats typically have plastic or rubber cylindrical covers for
the lower part of the shrouds and stays (the wires that hold up the
mast). These covers are apparently called "Turnbuckle Boots".

Turnbuckle boots should be topped off with caps, but it is quite common
to see the caps broken or missing entirely.

[Turnbuckle Boot
Cap](http://www.fabfabbers.com/models/id/150/shroudcap-by-chrisjrob "Turnbuckle Boot Cap")Â is
a replacement for those caps. It is fully parametric and printed
perfectly without support.
