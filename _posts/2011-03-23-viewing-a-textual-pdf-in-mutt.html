<p>I think there must be something wrong with me.  Why, in this age of graphical user interfaces, does it delight me so much that I can view textual PDFs within Mutt (on a remote server without a gui)?</p>
<p>To set this up, you need to install pdftotext.  This application is available in either poppler-utils or xpdf-utils - most people seem to use the latter, but I suspect the former is probably a better option for a text-only server.  I installed poppler-utils.</p>
<p>Next create (or edit) the <code>~/.mailcap</code> file, so that it has the following line:<!--more--><br />
<code><br />
application/pdf;                pdftotext -layout %s -; copiousoutput<br />
</code></p>
<p>You could also add the line:<br />
<code><br />
text/html;                      elinks %s; nametemplate=%s.html<br />
</code></p>
<p>The latter line opens HTML attachments in elinks.</p>
<p>Then just hit "V" when viewing an email, and you will see the attachments, select the attachment and hit Enter to view it.  Awesome :)</p>
