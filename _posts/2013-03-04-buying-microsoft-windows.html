<p>Having purchased <a title="Review of the Novatech nFinity n1410" href="/2013/02/22/the-novatech-nfinity-n1410-review/">my Novatech nFinity n1410</a>, I thought that I would install Windows as a virtual machine. Nothing easier, I thought, and trotted off to my local Currys.</p>
<p>On entering Currys there was plenty of evidence of the new Windows 8, but I noticed that <a title="Windows 8 at Curry's" href="http://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/search-keywords/323_3082_30147_xx_xx/windows+8/xx-criteria.html">all the copies were upgrades</a> from Windows 7 or Windows XP.  Currys explained that they do not stock full copies of Windows, only the upgrades, and stated that this was not a Curry's issue, but that it was a Microsoft policy to only sell full versions of Windows via their website.</p>
<p>So I found myself searching online for "<a title="Search Microsoft Buy Windows 8" href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=microsoft+buy+windows+8">buy windows 8</a>" and ended up on the <a title="Buy Windows 8" href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/buy">Microsoft site</a>, but, as with Currys, the only versions available were upgrades.<!--more--></p>
<p>Starting to feel like I'd entered the Twilight Zone, I <a title="Windows 8 at BT Business Direct" href="http://www.businessdirect.bt.com/category/computing,software,operating-systems/11168?q=windows%208">searched at BT Business Direct</a>, this seemed to be much more successful and I found <a title="Windows 8 Choices at BT Business Direct" href="http://www.businessdirect.bt.com/Product/Compare?CompareList=8BMQ%2C8BMS%2C8BMR%2C8BMT&amp;CategoryId=11168&amp;q=windows%208">4 choices available</a>, but all the versions were OEM copies which I assumed that I was not legally permitted to install on a VM. It appeared that the only choices were OEM licences or Retail upgrade licences, on the face of it - leaving users like myself unable to legally buy Windows at all.</p>
<p>I thought perhaps that this was a short-term anomaly post-launch, but <a title="Does a Full Retail Licence of Windows 8 exit?" href="http://superuser.com/questions/494782/does-a-full-retail-license-of-windows-8-exist-not-oem-not-upgrade">it seems not</a>. Apparently the OEM version is all things to all people, being both a Retail copy for non-system builders, and an OEM copy for system builders (<a title="Does a full retail license of windows 8 exist?" href="http://superuser.com/questions/494782/does-a-full-retail-license-of-windows-8-exist-not-oem-not-upgrade">read more</a>). If this is correct then this means that those 4 choices at BT Business Direct may be okay for me afterall.</p>
<p>And <a title="Personal Use Licence" href="http://www.microsoft.com/oem/en-gb/licensing/sblicensing/Pages/personal-use-license.aspx">here is the word from Microsoft on the matter</a>: <em>"If you are building a computer for your personal use or installing an additional operating system in a virtual machine, you can now purchase OEM System Builder software using the Personal Use Licence."</em> After pouring over the text of EULAs, this is actually easy and unequivocal. Well done Microsoft.</p>
<p>Knowing my preference for all-things GNU/Linux and FLOSS, some of you may be wondering why I need Windows at all. The reasons are very few and I don't use Windows from one month to the next, but I would find it difficult to eradicate completely:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height:13px;"><strong>Tax return:</strong> I know that <a title="How to Submit a UK Self Assessment Return Under Linux" href="http://bootpolish.net/home_howto_submitaukselfassessmentreturnunderlinux">it can be done under Linux</a>, but I prefer to use TaxCalc.</span></li>
<li><strong>Road Angel:</strong> I have found no way of updating my Dad's <a title="Road Angel" href="http://www.roadangelgroup.com">Road Angel</a> without Windows.</li>
<li><strong>Inforad:</strong> Similarly I have found no way of updating my <a title="Inforad" href="http://www.gpsinforad.co.uk/">Inforad</a> without Windows.</li>
<li><strong>Leappad2:</strong> I have found no way of updating my childrens' Leappad2's without Windows<span style="line-height:13px;">.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>So there we have it, we can now officially buy the OEM version for our VMs.</p>
<p>At least I think so.</p>
