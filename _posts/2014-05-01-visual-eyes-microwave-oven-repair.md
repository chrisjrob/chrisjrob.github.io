Our built-in De-Dietrich microwave over has been broken for weeks.
Initially the door catch had broken, but a replacement catch DIY-fitted
had not fixed the problem.

De-Dietrich's service agent wanted £195 to come out and fix the oven - a
ludicrous price for a 13 year old microwave. Other appliance repair
centres would either not repair microwave ovens at all, or particularly
excluded De-Dietrich.

Fortunately one such appliance repair person recommended that we contact
[Visual Eyes in Farnham,
Surrey](http://www.visual-eyes.eu/Pages/CommercialMicrowaveRepairs.aspx "Visual Eyes").
We did so, and the next day a nice man came and fixed our oven for £40.

Great service, thank you Visual Eyes.
