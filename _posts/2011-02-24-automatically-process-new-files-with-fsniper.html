<p>I had never heard of fsniper until it was mentioned in a mailing list today, but it sounds excellent:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.linux.com/archive/feature/150200">Linux.com :: Automatically process new files with fsniper</a></p>
<p>Now I am wondering if I can use it to prompt an rsync to sync our shared documents to our remote site, and <a title="Bio-Geeks" href="http://bio-geeks.com/?p=662">it seems I could</a>.  This is a major headache for me, as we have two branches and a shared documents repository.</p>
<p>I have previously tried using <a title="Unison File Syncrhonizer" href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/">Unison</a> to synchronise between the branches, but this has created a lot of load on the master server, massively slowing down performance for all the users on the master server.</p>
<p>We are currently using apache2+webdav+svn but this is not working well for us.  Potentially fsniper+rsync could work very well.  It would clearly need to be running on both servers and I can see a potential clash if the two servers happen to try and update the same file at the same time.  More thought is required, any suggestions - do let me know.</p>
<p>The links to the fsniper site seem to be outdated in both of the above articles, but it may be found at:</p>
<p><a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/fsniper">http://freshmeat.net/projects/fsniper</a></p>
<p>It doesn't appear to be packaged for Debian, but I will probably compile from source and try it soon.  More later!</p>
