After a week spent trying to install our Debian Lenny LTSP server, with the clients failing to boot with an error "rpc failed: 2", and everyone I spoke to baffled as to how this could occur, I decided that enough was enough, and deleted the partitions and started again.  Within 2 hours the server was back up and running without any of the same problems.

And a lesson learned: don't invest too much time in an install, without testing that the fundamentals are in place!
