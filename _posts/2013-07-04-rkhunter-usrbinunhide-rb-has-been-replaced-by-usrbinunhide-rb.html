<p>I have recently moved over to Rootkit Hunter (rkhunter) instead of using fcheck, one issue that I encountered on all our Ubuntu servers was the error:</p>
<pre>Warning: The command '/usr/bin/unhide.rb' has been replaced by a script: /usr/bin/unhide.rb: Ruby script</pre>
<p>Googling confirmed that this error was normal on Ubuntu systems, but I found no solution. Fortunately the solution was simple, simply editing /etc/rkhunter.conf and adding the following line at the appropriate place:</p>
<pre>SCRIPTWHITELIST=/usr/bin/unhide.rb</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
