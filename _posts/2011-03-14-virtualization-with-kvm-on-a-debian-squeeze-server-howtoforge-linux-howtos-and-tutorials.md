A nice howto for KVM and libvirt on Debian Squeeze:

[Virtualization With KVM On A Debian Squeeze Server | HowtoForge - Linux Howtos and Tutorials](http://www.howtoforge.com/virtualization-with-kvm-on-a-debian-squeeze-server)

I have used KVM, but never with libvirt.  I understand that libvirt is a
standard api for managing various virtualisation technologies, e.g. KVM,
QEMU, Xen and others, giving you a common way of managing your guests
regardless of the technology in use.
