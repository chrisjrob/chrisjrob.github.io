We're currently running fully managed ADSL 8mb Max Premium broadband
connections at our two branches.  The problem with this is that ADSL is
asynchronous, the download bandwidth being around 7mb and the upload
bandwidth being around 700k.  We are finding that the 700k upload
bandwidth is too small for sharing data between the branches, as the
speed is then limited to the upload connection - 700k.

Today I had a meeting with a telecoms expert to advise us on our
options, which seem to be:

<!--more-->

 *  **LLU (Local Loop Unbundled)** - this would boost download bandwidth
    to up to 24mb, but leave the upload bandwidth unchanged, there might
    also be a small quality improvement.  Maybe.
 *  **SDSL** - Synchronous DSL has the same upload and download
    bandwidth, unfortunately that bandwidth is just 2mb.  And is
    probably only available at one of our branches.  Cost is around £370
    install and £275 per month.
 *  **EFM (Ethernet First Mile)** - based on ISDN30, this uses twin
    twisted copper cables, which means that the service quality degrades
    the further you are from the exchange.  We would hope to receive
    close to 10mb bandwidth upload and download.  Cost is around £2000
    install and £500 per month.
 *  **E1 Leased Line** - a fibre product, offering 2mb upload and
    download bandwidth.  Install cost is around £3-5000 and £270pm.
 *  **LES10 Leased Line** - a fibre product, offering 10mb upload and
    download bandwidth.  Same day support.  Install cost is around
    £3-5000 and £500pm.
 *  **LES100 & LES1000 Leased Lines** - beyond our budget.

So the cheapest solution, SDSL, which actually would reduce our download
bandwidth, would still cost **three times** what we are currently
paying, and we would need to pay **six times** what we are currently
paying, in order to get the service that we need.

Other options that we could consider are:

 *  Multiple ADSL lines - load balanced
 *  Multiple ADSL lines - bonded

For example, we could double our costs by purchasing two separate ADSL
lines, and bonding such that the download bandwidth became 14mb with a
1.4mb upload bandwidth.  But is bonding reliable?  Our telecoms expert
could not remember a successful example of ADSL bonding, i.e. where the
customer didn't end up ditching the solution after a short time.  Is
that true do you think?

Ideally I would upgrade our connection for something that gave us 20mb+
download and 2mb upload.  Hmm, what about Virginmedia . . .

[Virginmedia](http://www.virginmediabusiness.co.uk/ "Virginmedia Business")
offers a 20mb connection for £50pm, but with an upload bandwidth of just
1mb, this wouldn't actually address our main problem.

So it does seem as if there is no cost-effective solution, and the price
gap between ADSL and Leased Lines seems very large - an additional
£10,000pa for our business.
