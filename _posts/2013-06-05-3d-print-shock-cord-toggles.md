[![3D Print: Shock Cord
Toggles]({{%20site.baseurl%20}}/assets/toggle.jpg)](http://www.fabfabbers.com/models/id/162/toggle-by-chrisjrob)

My [first ever
design](/2011/12/17/bungee-cord-toggles-by-chrisjrob-thingiverse/) was a
shock cord toggle, but I have only now had a reason to print it and I am
pleased to say that they are working perfectly. Shown here on my dinghy
- used to hold the oars when not in use.
