Having purchased [my Novatech nFinity
n1410](/2013/02/22/the-novatech-nfinity-n1410-review/ "Review of the Novatech nFinity n1410"),
I thought that I would install Windows as a virtual machine. Nothing
easier, I thought, and trotted off to my local Currys.

On entering Currys there was plenty of evidence of the new Windows 8,
but I noticed that [all the copies were
upgrades](http://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/search-keywords/323_3082_30147_xx_xx/windows+8/xx-criteria.html "Windows 8 at Curry's") from
Windows 7 or Windows XP.  Currys explained that they do not stock full
copies of Windows, only the upgrades, and stated that this was not a
Curry's issue, but that it was a Microsoft policy to only sell full
versions of Windows via their website.

So I found myself searching online for "[buy windows
8](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=microsoft+buy+windows+8 "Search Microsoft Buy Windows 8")"
and ended up on the [Microsoft
site](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/buy "Buy Windows 8"),
but, as with Currys, the only versions available were upgrades.

Starting to feel like I'd entered the Twilight Zone, I [searched at BT
Business
Direct](http://www.businessdirect.bt.com/category/computing,software,operating-systems/11168?q=windows%208 "Windows 8 at BT Business Direct"),
this seemed to be much more successful and I found [4 choices
available](http://www.businessdirect.bt.com/Product/Compare?CompareList=8BMQ%2C8BMS%2C8BMR%2C8BMT&CategoryId=11168&q=windows%208 "Windows 8 Choices at BT Business Direct"),
but all the versions were OEM copies which I assumed that I was not
legally permitted to install on a VM. It appeared that the only choices
were OEM licences or Retail upgrade licences, on the face of it -
leaving users like myself unable to legally buy Windows at all.

I thought perhaps that this was a short-term anomaly post-launch, but
[it seems
not](http://superuser.com/questions/494782/does-a-full-retail-license-of-windows-8-exist-not-oem-not-upgrade "Does a Full Retail Licence of Windows 8 exit?").
Apparently the OEM version is all things to all people, being both a
Retail copy for non-system builders, and an OEM copy for system builders
([read

If this is correct then this means that those 4 choices at BT Business
Direct may be okay for me afterall.

And [here is the word from Microsoft on the
matter](http://www.microsoft.com/oem/en-gb/licensing/sblicensing/Pages/personal-use-license.aspx "Personal Use Licence"):
*"If you are building a computer for your personal use or installing an
additional operating system in a virtual machine, you can now purchase
OEM System Builder software using the Personal Use Licence."* After
pouring over the text of EULAs, this is actually easy and unequivocal.
Well done Microsoft.

Knowing my preference for all-things GNU/Linux and FLOSS, some of you
may be wondering why I need Windows at all. The reasons are very few
and I don't use Windows from one month to the next, but I would find it
difficult to eradicate completely:

1.  **Tax return:** I know that [it can be done under
    Linux](http://bootpolish.net/home_howto_submitaukselfassessmentreturnunderlinux "How to Submit a UK Self Assessment Return Under Linux"),
    but I prefer to use TaxCalc.
2.  **Road Angel:** I have found no way of updating my Dad's [Road
    Angel](http://www.roadangelgroup.com "Road Angel") without Windows.
3.  **Inforad:** Similarly I have found no way of updating my
    [Inforad](http://www.gpsinforad.co.uk/ "Inforad") without Windows.
4.  **Leappad2:** I have found no way of updating my childrens'
    Leappad2's without Windows.

So there we have it, we can now officially buy the OEM version for our
VMs.

At least I think so.
