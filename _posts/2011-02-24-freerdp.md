For a long time I have noticed that the pace of development of rdesktop
seemed to have slowed, and that the rdesktop-users mailing list had gone
quiet.  What I hadn't noticed until recently is that there is now an
alternative called [FreeRDP](http://www.freerdp.com/).

FreeRDP is a fork of the rdesktop project that intends to rapidly start
moving forward and implement features that rdesktop lacks the most.
