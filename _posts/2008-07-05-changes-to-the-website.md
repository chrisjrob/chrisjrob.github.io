I can't believe a week has passed, with no blog entry.  Apologies.

This week I have added my About Linux and About Windows pages, including Why Linux and Protecting your Windows PC.  I hope that these pages will help users to recognise the issues running Windows systems and consider using Linux instead.  I have also moved my Windows for Linux page under the About Linux.  Still don't think I have the site layout quite right yet, so don't be surprised if they all move around again!

This week has seen a big push to get our last Windows users over to LTSP.  It's gone pretty well, although we still have problems printing to our [Konica Minolta C250 photocopier]({% post_url 2008-07-05-konica-minolta-c250-printing-problems %}).  I have three users remaining, all three of which will prove the greatest challenge, but also the greatest opportunity - in some ways they have the most to gain from Linux.  They just don't know it yet!
