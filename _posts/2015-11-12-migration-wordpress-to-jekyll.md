For the past few weeks I have migrating chrisjrob.com from Wordpress to Jekyll. 
I have also been merging in my previous blog at bootpolish.net. 

This process has proved to be much more work than I expected, but this evening it all came together and I finally pressed the button to transfer the DNS over to the Jekyll site, hosted by GitHub.

I have tried to maintain the URL structure, along with tags, categories and RSS feeds, but it can't be perfect and there will be breakage.

If you notice any problems please do comment below.

Thank you.
