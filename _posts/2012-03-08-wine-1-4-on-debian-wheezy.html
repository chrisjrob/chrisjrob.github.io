<p><strong>Update <a title="Wine 1.5 Announcement" href="http://www.winehq.org/announce/1.5.0">Wine 1.5 has now been announced</a>!</strong></p>
<p>I was delighted to read this morning that <a title="Wine 1.4 Released" href="http://www.winehq.org/news/2012030701">Wine 1.4 stable had been released</a>, a quick ...<br />
<code>dpkg -l wine</code><br />
... revealed that my Debian Wheezy install was running version 1.0.1, several significant versions old. Â There may be good stability reasons for that decision, but I can afford to be a little more adventurous on my desktop PC.</p>
<p>So the question was how to build, well <a title="Wine 1.4 out now -- very brief build instructions" href="http://verahill.blogspot.com/2012/03/wine-14-out-now-very-brief-build.html">some brief and helpful instructions are already available</a>.</p>
<p>The only ways I deviated from these instructions was to use the standard Wine option for the build:</p>
<p><code> $ cd tmp/<br />
$ ./tools/wineinstall<br />
</code></p>
<p>Taking the option for "no" to build without installation, and once complete I installed with:</p>
<p><code>sudo checkinstall</code></p>
<p>Checkinstall is a wonderful program to install from source via a Deb package, that can later be uninstalled or upgraded.</p>
<p>Many thanks to lindqvist for saving me the hassle of working out the dependencies!</p>
