I recently made a payment to an on-line supplier, via "Nochex".  The supplier failed to come up with the goods and then failed to respond to my emails.  I submitted a support ticket to Nochex and they promised to respond with 48 hours, but failed to do so.

After conducting further research, it seems that Nochex itself [does not have the best reputation](http://www.reviewcentre.com/reviews115027.html).

Further to this, I contacted them again, and once again they have failed to respond within 24 hours.
