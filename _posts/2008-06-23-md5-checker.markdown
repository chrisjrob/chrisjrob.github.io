Linux includes "md5sum" utility for checking MD5 values of downloaded applications.  I find it a nuisance having to drop into a command shell and execute...

    $ md5sum download.iso

And then manually compare with the author's.  I have therefore written a simple KDE ServiceMenu to add MD5 checking.

Simply [download] and extract to `/home/*USERNAME*/.kde/share/apps/konqueror/servicemenus`.
