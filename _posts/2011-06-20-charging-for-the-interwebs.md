One of the most wonderful things about the web and open source are that
all you need is a computer, an Internet connection, a domain name and a
text editor and you can host your own website. The Internet is a great
equaliser - a teenager in his/her bedroom truly can reach out to the
world with a service that is every bit as good as those created by
billion-dollar companies and maybe better.

Until now.

In their infinite wisdom 
[ICANN has enabled custom TLDs](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/06/20/icann_expands_gtlds/ "ICANN opens the domain floodgates")
from $185,000 plus $25,000 per annum.

Needless to say, this limits their availability only to large companies.
No longer is there a level playing field - large companies can pay for a
TLD that is simply not available to smaller companies, organisations or
individuals.

Does this matter? Well I don't know for certain, but this is the first
time that part of the Internet has been closed off to the rest of us,
and it just doesn't feel right to me.
