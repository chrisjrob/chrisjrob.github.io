When we moved into our new house one irritation was that the kitchen was
not really bad enough to warrant replacing, but the laminate worktop was
looking tired and was really dragging the kitchen down. We decided to
see if we could replace our worktop with a new granite one.

The first quote we received was three times what we expected, and we
could have had a new kitchen for very little more. The second quote was
more reasonable, but still 50% more than we were prepared to spend. Some
desperate Googling came up with [Affordable
Granite](http://www.affordablegranite.co.uk/ "Affordable Granite").

There were other similar sites around, but some Googling revealed many
positive customer reviews for Affordable Granite, and so we made
contact. The quote was still over our initial budget, but far less than
the other quotes received and we accepted their quote.

Well to cut a long story short, our new kitchen worktop looks fabulous
and was not only less expensive than the other quotes that we received,
had fewer compromises (decent thickness granite, included a new
under-mounted sink and an additional breakfast bar), and was completed
in a single week when other companies were suggesting two weeks. Better
still our hob and sink were kept operational for all but two days, when
one supplier told us that they would be disconnected at the beginning
and reconnected at the end.

The actual installation did not go completely smoothly, thanks to our
kitchen units being uneven and the adjustable feet having seized up,
with the result that we had workmen on site for longer than expected.
But at all times this remained their problem and not ours and they did
everything possible to ensure that our kitchen was completed on-time.

In short we are delighted with our new kitchen and very happy with the
service received from Affordable Granite.
