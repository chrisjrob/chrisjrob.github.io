I finally persuaded one of my brothers to move to Linux.  I explained that he would be able to continue using Firefox, Thunderbird, CD/DVD burning.  I waxed lyrical about the benefits in terms of reliability, virus-protection, ease of updating etc.  I showed him all the software, and in particular the Gcompris and KDE Education suites.

I warned him that there were issues connecting third party hardware (GPS, Phones etc), but he could see the benefits and felt able to cope with them.

Then:

   * Q. *"Will it work with my iPod?"*
   * A. "Yes, really well - I have mine working in Amarok - no problem at all."
   * Q. *"Will I still be able to use iTunes?"*
   * A. "No, but there are some great music players on Linux." (slight feeling of trepidation)
   * Q. *"Do they link up to the iTunes website?"*
   * A. "Eh, no" (I can see where this is going)
   * Q. *"Is there an alternative comparable download site?"*
   * A. "Yes I think Napster is similar" (hoping I wouldn't be proved wrong)
   * Q. *"Presumably I can transfer all my iTunes purchased music over to Linux?"*
   * A. Silence (except for the thumping as my head hit my desk repeatedly)

Yours somewhat depressed.
