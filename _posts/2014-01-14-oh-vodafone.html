<p>Oh Vodafone, please explain to me,<br />
how a business based on technology,<br />
can be so bad at web-based stuff?<br />
Really, downloading a bill should not be so tough!</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>I understand that I must now log on,<br />
and pasting your password can no longer be done,<br />
but why does it have to take me all day,<br />
<span style="line-height:1.5em;">to reach what could have been one click away?</span></p>
<p>The fact that the invoice is live generated,<br />
is clever technology, though that could be debated,<br />
but would it not be easier all round,<br />
if the invoice was sitting ready to bring down?</p>
<p>I would not mind if the system was quick,<br />
but I click and I wait and I wait and I click.<br />
So next time you think of a clever solution,<br />
think, will it be quick and will it be easy?</p>
<p>Unable to succesfully[sic] process request.<br />
ERR-010: Request timeout.<br />
Contact the application system administrator or Help Desk.<br />
Sigh.</p>
