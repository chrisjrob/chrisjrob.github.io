Temptation got the better of me (as usual) and I installed kde-compiz.  Unsurprisingly the very basic graphic card, on this business-focused laptop, gave a pretty poor compiz performance.  If you're after 3D acceleration for gaming and desktop effects, then you're probably looking for a different laptop!
