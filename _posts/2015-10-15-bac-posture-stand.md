Being tall (6'2"), sedentary and over 40, I have succumbed to the inevitable
back problems. Listening to [Jono's review of the LIFT Standing Desk on Bad
Voltage][lift] reminded me that I've been
meaning to try out working standing up, at least for part of the time. I
haven't gone for the LIFT, as I wasn't able to find it on Amazon UK, but I have
purchased the Bac Posture Stand, better known on Amazon as [Portable Folding
Notebook or Laptop Table - Desk - Tray - Stand -
(Black)][bac].

Hmm catchy.

It appears to be well made, although it does take a little setting up.
There is no fan cooling, but there are holes for natural venting. One
pleasant surprise was that it does include a mouse stand, which is not
shown in the Amazon picture. There was a cheaper alternative, but the
reviews led me to believe that this one might work out better. As I am
not planning to buy both - I will never know.

It is early days and I don't yet have a standing mat for home, which I
understand from that podcast is absolutely essential, but so far I am
pleased with my purchase.

I have also invested in a [VARIDESK Pro Plus 48 - Height Adjustable
Standing Desk][varidesk] for work, along with a [VARIDESK - Standing Desk Floor
Mat][mat].

I will review these in due course.
