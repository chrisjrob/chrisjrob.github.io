On my boat there was a locker below the cooker that was not closing
properly. The problem was that the retaining clip was broken. Normally
the only solution would be to buy a new clip, but this is the perfect
use for a 3D printer, as it enables you to re-create just the broken
half. And, even better, you can design the screw holes to be in the same
place, enabling a super quick replacement.
