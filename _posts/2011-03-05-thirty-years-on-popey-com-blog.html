<p><a href="http://popey.com/blog/2011/03/05/thirty-years-on/">Apparently the ZX81 is 30 years' old</a>, wow. &nbsp;<a title="Read about the ZX81 on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81">The wedge-shaped box</a> that started my interest in computers, and led inexorably to my love of Linux and tinkering with the command-line.</p>
<p>Popey clearly has a better memory than I, but&nbsp;I do remember rushing up to my bedroom with <a title="Read about the ZX81 on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81">ZX81</a> in hand, plugging it all in and then at the prompt typing “hello”. I was very disappointed that the computer seemed to have no ability to talk back! But once I got passed that disappointment, I fell in love with the thing. I didn’t do much programming on it, but I used to get the computer magazines and type in the assembly code in order to play games. There was an&nbsp;<a style="outline-width:0;outline-style:initial;outline-color:initial;font-size:13px;vertical-align:baseline;background-image:initial;background-attachment:initial;background-color:transparent;color:#004b91;background-position:initial initial;background-repeat:initial initial;border:0 initial initial;margin:0;padding:0;" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_Monster_Maze">awesome dinosaur game</a> I remember.</p>
<p>I was fortunate enough to be able to have the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum" title="Read about the ZX Spectrum on Wikipedia">ZX Spectrum</a> when it came out and was blown away by how much better it was than the ZX81. I remember the games with such fondness, but sadly many of them are still available on the net – and they’re actually a bit crap – but at the time they seemed absolutely incredible. I spent many a happy hour with <a style="outline-width:0;outline-style:initial;outline-color:initial;font-size:13px;vertical-align:baseline;background-image:initial;background-attachment:initial;background-color:transparent;color:#004b91;background-position:initial initial;background-repeat:initial initial;border:0 initial initial;margin:0;padding:0;" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jetpac">Jetpack</a>. But the main memory I have is anxiously waiting whilst the games retrieved from the audio cassettes – would it load? Can you imagine a storage technology that was so slow and only worked 2 in every 3 times – laughable really.</p>
