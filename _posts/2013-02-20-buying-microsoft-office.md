Whilst [my Company](http://www.tridenthonda.co.uk "Trident Honda") is
predominantly a Linux user, it has not been without its problems.
OpenOffice in particular struggles with some newer Powerpoint
presentations and the lack of the Calibri font seems to cause layout
issues. More recently, our primary system vendor has introduced
"Business Intelligence" as a product and we would like to take the
benefit of that. Unfortunately most of those benefits are only available
if you are also running Microsoft Excel 2010 and later, whilst we of
course use OpenOffice.

So, with a heavy heart I reached for my dog-eared copy of the Internet,
to see what this would cost me. I knew I needed Microsoft Office
Professional, as Microsoft Access is occasionally needed. I found that
[a full retail licence from BT Business
Direct](http://www.businessdirect.bt.com/products/microsoft-office-professional-2010---licence---1-pc---pkc---win---english-7258.html?q=office%202010 "BT Business Direct - Microsoft Office Professional 2010") cost
£205 plus VAT, not so bad after all.

I considered buying 12 of these full retail licences, but decided in the
end to contact our BT account manager to request a quote. I was informed
by BT that the full retail licences could not be used on a server; no
explanation was given for this, but I was assured that this was the
case.  The result was that the cost would in fact be £288 each, an
additional £1000. A rather strange reversal of the usual - the more you
buy, the lower the unit price.

As I was going to be installing on a virtual machine, I was also
interested in knowing that I would be able to reinstall on a new virtual
machine, if for any reason I needed to rebuild. For some reason this
seemed far less clear than I would have liked, but ultimately I did
receive that assurance; albeit in a way that left me wondering if that
would indeed ultimately prove to be the case.

One additional confusion is that 2013 is just out, and so there was a
choice of 2010 or 2013, we had been told to buy 2010 or later, in order
to work with Business Intelligence, but then I read an article on ZDNet
[Can Microsoft bring BI to the masses if the Excel 2013 masses can't get
BI?](http://www.zdnet.com/can-microsoft-bring-bi-to-the-masses-if-the-excel-2013-masses-cant-get-bi-7000011450/ "Can Microsoft bring BI to the masses if the Excel 2013 masses can't get BI?").
The upshot seems to be that Microsoft Office Professional 2013 may not
be enough - I might need Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013, which
as far as I can see is not even listed on BT Business Direct.

I visited the Microsoft page on [Microsoft Office Professional Plus
2013](http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/professional-plus/ "Microsoft Office Professional Plus") but
this left me none the wiser. Following the link to [Licensing
Options](http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/business/microsoft-office-volume-licensing-suites-comparison-FX101812899.aspx "Licensing Options")
looked promising, but was not. Following the link to [View Licensing
Options](http://www.microsoft.com/licensing/licensing-options/enterprise.aspx#tab=4 "View Licensing Options") - seemed
to suggest that the only option was a three year Enterprise Agreement,
but there was no pricing shown, not even under the "Volume Pricing"
heading.

So now I need to re-contact BT to find out if they offer Professional
Plus 2013 and try and find out if this is what I need and whether I can
in fact reinstall on different hardware.

To seasoned purchasers of proprietary software this might all seem par
for the course, or perhaps there is an easier way that I have not yet
found? I suspect that the truth is that we are too large a company for
buying single licences, but too small a company for an enterprise
agreement. Neither fish nor fowl, as the saying goes.

But, for the past 5 years or so, I have not had to think about licensing
once. If I need a copy of office, then I download
[OpenOffice](http://www.openoffice.org/ "OpenOffice") (or more recently
[LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/ "LibreOffice")); if I need a
desktop publishing program, then I download
[Scribus](http://www.scribus.net/ "Scribus"); a graphics editor, [the
GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/ "The GNU Image Manipulation Program"); an
illustrator, [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/ "Inkscape"). And for each
of those programs I can install it for all staff without even a thought
about how many licences I might have available.

There is no way out for me, sadly, and I will need to navigate these
difficult waters whether I like it or not, but there **is** a better way
and that way is [Free Libre Open Source Software
(FLOSS)](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/FLOSS_Concept_Booklet "FLOSS Concept Booklet").
