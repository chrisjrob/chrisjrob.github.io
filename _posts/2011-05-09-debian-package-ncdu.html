<p>We all know that feeling when our disk fills up and you are left desperately scrabbling around to find out where your disk space has gone.  In <a href="/2011/02/24/analyse-disk-usage-with-konqueror/" title="Analyse disk usage with&nbsp;Konqueror">a previous blog post I discussed the use of the wonderful Konqueror File Size View</a>, but this is no good for remote servers.  Normally I would resort to "du" or the wonderful "find" utility to look for large files, but here is an interesting alternative that I had not come across before: ncdu (ncurses disk usage).<br />
<!--more--><br />
Its name tells you pretty much everything you need to know.  It can be installed with a simple <code>apt-get install ncdu</code> and then the man page is a useful guide.  In simple terms it can just be run with:</p>
<p><code># ncdu /var</code></p>
<p>The lovely thing about ncdu is that once it completes its run (which can take a long time on a large disk or a nfs share), you can drill into the directory structure following the disk usage to determine where your space has gone.</p>
<p>It is a very simple program but one that I will find most useful.</p>
