I wanted to change my blog so that the home page only has an opening
paragraph of each blog post, rather than having the full text.  In my
opinion this makes the blog easier and more pleasant to navigate.
 Unfortunately it seems that in trying to achieve this, I changed the
RSS feed as well.

<!--more-->

My apologies for this error, it wasn't deliberate and I do appreciate
that it is more convenient to read the whole text from within your
chosen RSS aggregator.  Although it was nice having the additional page
views - twice as many today as yesterday...

I think I have corrected the problem, so we should be back to full text
for this and all subsequent posts.  If not, let me know!
