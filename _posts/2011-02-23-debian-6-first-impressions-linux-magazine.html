<p>Apparently I am not the only one that thinks that the Debian graphics are appalling:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.linux-mag.com/id/8188/">Debian 6: First Impressions | Linux Magazine</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Debian did have a design contest of sorts, well a brief mailing list thread that had the impossible task of voting the best out of just a handful of rubbish themes.  Given the choices, personally I would have opted for the upstream themes, or just to stick with the Debian Lenny theme which was perfectly okay.</p>
<p>I do wonder how easy or difficult it is to submit themes - do you have to be a Debian developer?  If so, then they should really think about lowering the bar.  I'm sure that I could produce something better, although <a title="chrisjrob @ kde-look" href="http://kde-look.org/content/search.php?user=chrisjrob&amp;search=Search">my last attempt</a> does not appear to be getting widespread approval.</p>
<p>Anyhow, we don't love Debian for how pretty is looks - we can soon change the theme if it bothers us.</p>
