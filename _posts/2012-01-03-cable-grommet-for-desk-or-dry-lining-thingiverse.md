Having mounted my LED television on the wall I have a 80mm hole behind
the TV, through which all the cables arrive. No-one can see it of
course, but I know it's there and it needs finishing, otherwise I might
start muttering incoherently.

So I decided to create a [cable grommet to fit into the dry-lining wall][grommet].
This is still very much work-in-progress, and in particular I need to
find a way to cope with the necessary overhang on each side. It also
needs a removable cap, so that you can easily feed additional cables,
hopefully I will get these issues addressed very soon.

It was designed in openscad and fully parametric, it could doubtless be
used for other purposes, including a desk grommet.
