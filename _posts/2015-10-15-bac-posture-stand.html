<p>Being tall (6'2"), sedentary and over 40, I have succumbed to the inevitable back problems. Listening to <a href="http://www.badvoltage.org/2015/09/17/1x50/">Jono's review of the LIFT Standing Desk on Bad Voltage</a> reminded me that I've been meaning to try out working standing up, at least for part of the time. I haven't gone for the LIFT, as I wasn't able to find it on Amazon UK, but I have purchased the Bac Posture Stand, better known on Amazon as <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00N1VUS1G/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B00N1VUS1G&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=robsquadnet-21">Portable Folding Notebook or Laptop Table - Desk - Tray - Stand - (Black)</a><img style="border:none !important;margin:0!important;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ir?t=robsquadnet-21&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B00N1VUS1G" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" />. Hmm catchy.</p>
<p>It appears to be well made, although it does take a little setting up. There is no fan cooling, but there are holes for natural venting. One pleasant surprise was that it does include a mouse stand, which is not shown in the Amazon picture. There was a cheaper alternative, but the reviews led me to believe that this one might work out better. As I am not planning to buy both - I will never know.</p>
<p>It is early days and I don't yet have a standing mat for home, which I understand from that podcast is absolutely essential, but so far I am pleased with my purchase.</p>
<p>I have also invested in a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00UKES3S2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B00UKES3S2&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=robsquadnet-21">VARIDESK Pro Plus 48 - Height Adjustable Standing Desk</a><img style="border:none !important;margin:0!important;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ir?t=robsquadnet-21&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B00UKES3S2" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> for work, along with a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00IU4FMOM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B00IU4FMOM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=robsquadnet-21">VARIDESK - Standing Desk Floor Mat</a><img style="border:none !important;margin:0!important;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ir?t=robsquadnet-21&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B00IU4FMOM" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" />. I will review these in due course.</p>
