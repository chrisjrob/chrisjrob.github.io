It astonishes me that so many people are prepared to go along with the
"convenience" of accepting limited access to the content that they
purchase. This [Open Letter to E-Book
Retailers](http://www.teleread.com/drm/an-open-letter-to-e-book-retailers-lets-have-a-return-to-common-sense/ "An Open Letter to E-Book Retailers: Let’s have a return to common sense") explains
the issues with great clarity.

If you support this letter, please share and re-post.
