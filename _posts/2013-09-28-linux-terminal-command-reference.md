I thought that this [Linux Terminal Command
Reference](http://community.linuxmint.com/tutorial/view/244 "Linux Terminal Command Reference") from
the Mint community was excellent. Having learned them piecemeal over
many years, I was almost resentful to see them all listed together.
Linux shouldn't be easy, it should be knowledge painfully acquired
through years of humiliation on IRC channels and mailing lists!
