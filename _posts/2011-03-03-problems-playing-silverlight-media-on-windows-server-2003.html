<p>We have to be able to play Silverlight media on our two virtual Windows Server 2003 servers.  This is completely unavoidable, because you first need to authenticate via an Active-X website, so any option of using Moonlight on Linux was impossible.</p>
<p>The problem that we had was that when we clicked on the Play Media button, there were two pop ups stating ﻿"This page has an unspecified potential security risk" followed by another stating "A problem was encountered with the media file specified."</p>
<p>I tried bypassing our proxy server;  I ensured that the Internet Enhanced Security was uninstalled; I tried adding the relevant sites to "Trusted sites"; I tried reducing Trusted Sites to "Low" security; I brought all the critical updates up-to-date.  Nothing seemed to make a difference.<!--more--></p>
<p>Finally, I decided to review the optional Windows updates, just to see if there was anything related to Silverlight and noticed that there was a major update to .net available ".NET framework 4". Knowing that Silverlight is a .net technology, I installed it and, after yet another reboot, the pop ups had gone and it was working.</p>
<p>My reason for writing about it is simply this:  I had googled endlessly about this problem, without any success, there was seemingly nothing relevant to this problem.  Hopefully this post will help others.</p>
<p>But you should be using Linux not Windows!  There, couldn't resist ;)</p>
