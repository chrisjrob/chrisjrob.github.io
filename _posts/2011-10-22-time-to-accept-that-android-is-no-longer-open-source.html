<p>I read today that <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2011/10/google-and-samsung-unveil-galaxy-nexus-android-4-at-event.ars" title="Google and Samsung unveil Galaxy Nexus Android 4" target="_blank">Google and Samsung have unveiled Galaxy Nexus Android 4</a>.</p>
<p>It has been well known that the <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/google/google-android-30-honeycomb-open-source-no-more/2845" title="Google Android 3.0 Honeycomb: Open source no more" target="_blank">Android 3.x is not open source</a> yet, but I had expected 3.x to be open sourced at any moment.  Now that 4.x has been released and there is <a href="http://source.android.com/" title="Android Source Code" target="_blank">still no sign of the 3.x or 4.x source code</a>, I think we have to ask - is Android really open source now?</p>
<p>Well <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2119266/google-commits-source-android-calendar-api" target="_blank">Google has given some reassurances that 4.x will be open sourced</a> "We plan to release the source for the recently-announced Ice Cream Sandwich soon, once it's available on devices", but this lacks credibility when they still haven't released the code for 3.x.</p>
<p>This could all change in moment, all it takes is for Google to publish the source code, but this is truly not how an open source project is supposed to be run.</p>
<p>2011-11-03: Further to this article, Google has announced that <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/open-source/google-android-40-to-be-open-sourced-in-coming-weeks/9852" title="Google Android 4.0 to be open sourced in coming weeks">Android 4.0 is to be open sourced in the coming weeks</a>.</p>
