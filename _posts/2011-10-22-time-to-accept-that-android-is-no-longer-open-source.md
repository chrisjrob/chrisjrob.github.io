I read today that [Google and Samsung have unveiled Galaxy Nexus Android 4](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2011/10/google-and-samsung-unveil-galaxy-nexus-android-4-at-event.ars "Google and Samsung unveil Galaxy Nexus Android 4").

It has been well known that the [Android 3.x is not open source](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/google/google-android-30-honeycomb-open-source-no-more/2845 "Google Android 3.0 Honeycomb: Open source no more")
yet, but I had expected 3.x to be open sourced at any moment. Now that
4.x has been released and there is [still no sign of the 3.x or 4.x source code](http://source.android.com/ "Android Source Code"), I think
we have to ask - is Android really open source now?

<!--more-->

Well [Google has given some reassurances that 4.x will be open sourced](http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2119266/google-commits-source-android-calendar-api)
*"We plan to release the source for the recently-announced Ice Cream
Sandwich soon, once it's available on devices"*, but this lacks
credibility when they still haven't released the code for 3.x.

This could all change in moment, all it takes is for Google to publish
the source code, but this is truly not how an open source project is
supposed to be run.

2011-11-03: Further to this article, Google has announced that 
[Android 4.0 is to be open sourced in the coming weeks](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/open-source/google-android-40-to-be-open-sourced-in-coming-weeks/9852 "Google Android 4.0 to be open sourced in coming weeks").
