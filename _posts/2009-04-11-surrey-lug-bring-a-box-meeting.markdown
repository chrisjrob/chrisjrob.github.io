I've just returned from my first [Bring-a-Box meeting at Nokia in Farnborough](http://surrey.lug.org.uk/Meetings/BringABox/Archive/20090411).  I found it hugely enjoyable to have people who actually want to talk about Linux.

I was introduced to Firestarter, which is a GUI to configure a firewall and share your Internet connection, if you so wish, I'm looking forward to having a play with this.
