I have been repeatedly astonished by the number of people who have no idea that any alternative to Microsoft Windows actually exists.  Here is a list of just a few with Links to their respective Wikipedia pages:

   * [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) (open source)
   * [Apple Mac OS X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X) (proprietary)
   * [BSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution) (open source)
   * More &rarr; [List of operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_operating_systems)

It is worth mentioning at this point that Apple Mac OS X is a proprietary closed system, whilst the others are open source.

I recommend Linux - [Why Linux?]({% post_url 2009-03-21-why-linux %}).
