Phase 1 of the build of my RepRap Prusa is now complete and I have
photographed it thoroughly, to assist others with their build and for
general interest (there are more photos behind this one).

I have even taken a brief video, apologies for the lack of lighting:

The instructions I followed were the [Prusa Mendel Assembly](http://reprap.org/wiki/Prusa_Mendel_Assembly) instructions,
with modifications described in the Thames Valley Google Groups thread
[Frame bearing specifics?](http://groups.google.com/group/tvreprapug/browse_thread/thread/8bc73f36ce2bf04d).

This Prusa is 16mm wider than standard, in order to allow for the heated
bed. For further details on the design being followed, please visit:

Looking forward to Phase 2 of the build!
