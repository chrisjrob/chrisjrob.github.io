Three things I love about [pekwm](http://www.pekwm.org/ "PekWM"):

**Window grouping:** I love the fact that you can middle click on a
window's titlebar and drop it onto another window and the two
windows join together - with the titlebar split in segments. You can
switch between the applications by clicking on the relevant part of
the titlebar, or use the Windows key with TAB - so just as Alt+Tab
switches between windows, Windows+Tab switches between the
applications grouped inside the current window.

**Double-click to fill available space:** I love the fact that you
can open an application and just double-click on its titlebar to
fill the available space. This feels so intuitive and just so damned
right, that I struggle to understand why it is not the standard
behaviour in all window managers and desktop environments.

**Clicking on the desktop edge moves you to the next workspace:**
I've never really got on with multiple desktops/workspaces - it is
difficult enough to keep track of multiple applications inside a
single workspace, but pekwm has converted me. I find it just so
intuitive that, by clicking on the edge of the desktop, that it it
progresses you to the next desktop.

So what do **you** love about pekwm?
