---++ Step 1 - Install bootchart

%RAW%
<pre>
# aptitude install bootchart
</pre>
%RAW%

---++ Step 2 - Update Grub

%RAW%
<pre>
# nano /boot/grub/menu.lst
</pre>
%RAW%

Look for a line that looks like this:

%RAW%
<pre>
# altoptions=(single-user mode) single
</pre>
%RAW%

And add a similar line after it that looks like this:

%RAW%
<pre>
# altoptions=(single-user mode) single
# altoptions=(bootchart) init=/sbin/bootchartd
</pre>
%RAW%

Then update your grub entries by typing:

%RAW%
<pre>
# update-grub
</pre>
%RAW%

---++ Step 3 - Reboot

Reboot, making sure that you select the bootchart option from the grub menu.

Once the boot has finished, open a terminal and type:

%RAW%
<pre>
$ bootchart
</pre>
%RAW%

---++ Step 4 - Analyse

You chould find a new png image in your current directory (the one you ran the bootchart command from) called bootchart.png.  Open it, analyse it and write a really good howto on how to optimise your system, and then publish it on the web!

Good luck!
