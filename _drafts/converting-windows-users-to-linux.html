<p>For several years I have been enthusing about Linux to anyone who would listen.  When people come to me for advice on buying a new computer, I always include options for Linux as well as Windows and try to honestly explain the pros and cons of each.</p>
<p>Most people have fairly simple needs, but get frustrated with the malware and inevitable slow-down of Windows.  Surely this makes them ideal converts to Linux?</p>
<p>Well apparently not, I have only succeeded in converting a handful of people, and those have not been entirely successful.  In particular my Linux converts have found a number of shortcomings with Linux:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hardware incompatibility:</strong> Unable to use their Garmin, Road Angel, TomTom and certain models of iPods.</li>
<li><strong>Software unintuitive:</strong> None of my converts have found Amarok and Digikam intuitive, and preferred iTunes and Picasa.</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge:</strong> My converts all feel lost in Linux and have remained utterly dependant upon me.</li>
<li><strong>Internet Explorer</strong> The lack of Internet Explorer has caused problems for just one of my converts.</li>
</ul>
<p>However good we find Digikam and Amarok, the fact is that (in my experience at least) the average Windows user thinks that they are horrible and awkward to use.  They all seem to see iTunes and Picasa as the holy grail and nothing else quite compares.  And don't get me started on the GIMP.</p>
<p>So what can I learn from these experiences?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gnome not KDE</strong> KDE has certainly not worked for my converts, so I think it is time to try Gnome.</li>
<li><strong>F-Spot or Picasa</strong> I will look at F-Spot, but unless it is as user-friendly as Picasa, then I'm going to install Picasa from the outset.</li>
<p>I suspect I should have opted for Gnome rather than KDE, I chose KDE because it seems more Windows-like and because I know it better.  I now think that they would have had less problems with the simplicity of Gnome.  And perhaps there were <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/10things/10-things-you-can-do-to-keep-your-new-linux-users-from-bailing-on-you/1758">other things I could have done differently</a>.</p>
</ul>
