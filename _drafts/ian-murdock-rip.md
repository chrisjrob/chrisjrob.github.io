On Monday 28 December 2015 one of my heroes died.

Ian Murdock was the founder of the [Debian] distribution of Linux, which I have been using since around 2002. 
Debian had been recommended to me by Matt, a software engineer working for a systems vendor that we were then using. 
He had recommended that I consider using a Debian server to remove spam from our mailserver, using SpamAssassin.

I had never met Ian Murdock, but I followed him on Twitter some years ago. 
Unlike other prominent figures in the Linux world he never said much, so added little to my Twitter stream.

Until Monday 28 December 2015.

I had just switched off the television and was about to go to bed. 
Like many of us these days I could not resist having a quick look at my tablet and was horrified to see that Ian Murdock was planning to commit suicide. 
Had his Twitter account been hacked? Was he really planning to commit suicide?
I saw that others had seen his posts, including those that knew him, and hoped that this dreadful
