---++ 20/11/2008: RSS feeds

Yes, you're right, my RSS feed is rubbish.  The RSS feed is generated by my own script, which was rather hastily cobbled together.  I am currently playing with Drupal and am loving it.  Rather than sort out my RSS feed, what I would like to do is migrate over to Drupal at some point in the future, and let that handle the feeds.

Watch this space!
