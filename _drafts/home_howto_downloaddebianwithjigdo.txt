---++ Where to get downloads

Download the appropriate .jigdo and .template file into a suitable directory on your system.

---++ Reducing your download

Pretty much the raison-d'etre of jigdo is the ability to re-use an existing CD to reduce the number of files to be downloaded.  But if you're anything like me it's much easier to use an ISO:

<pre>
$ sudo mkdir /mnt/cdrom
$ sudo mount -o loop debian-LennyBeta2-i386-kde-CD-1.iso /mnt/cdrom
</pre>

Now just enter /mnt/cdrom as the path to the CD to use
