I made the difficult decision yesterday to stop drinking.

I have always had a troubled relationship with alcohol.
For example - drinking too much and saying things that I later regretted; but I love wine, beer and love nothing better than meeting friends at the pub for a few beers.

About a year ago I stopped drinking Monday to Wednesday, when typically I would have had a single drink after work.
This was much harder than I expected, as I found that I was craving a drink when I returned home from work.

Eventually I succeeded, and in many ways it has been a great success - I can come home without craving a drink, I can volunteer to drive without resentment, and generally I do feel that this has been a positive change.

But there have been some negatives&hellip;

I seem to have less control of my drinking on the days when I still drink, such that instead of just having a couple, I find myself having four or more drinks.

I don't really understand how this can be, but I have seen the pattern repeat often enough to know that it is a problem.
In some ways I would like to go back to how I was - drinking daily but not to excess, but I do have quite high cholesterol as well as sleep apnoea, and both are likely because of alcohol.

I also have no way of knowing whether I would get back control if I started drinking daily - I might find my current pattern of drinking extending to every day.

So I have decided to give up alcohol.
Initially just for a month, to give myself a chance to see how I am without it, but I am expecting it to be a permanent change.
