---++ What are the alternatives

I have been repeatedly astonished by the number of people who have no idea that any alternative to Microsoft Windows actually exists.  Here is a list of just a few with Links to their respective Wikipedia pages:

   * `Linux` (open source)
   * `Apple Mac OS X` (proprietary)
   * `BSD` (open source)
   * More >> `List of operating systems`

It is worth mentioning at this point that Apple Mac OS X is a proprietary closed system, whilst the others are `open source`.

I recommend Linux - Why Linux?
