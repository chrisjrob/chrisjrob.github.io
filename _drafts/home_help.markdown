## Editing Help

If you are an authorised user, you will see an [edit page] at the top and bottom of every page. Click on this button and the page will re-open in Edit Mode.

The Edit Mode accepts plain text and will work without any of the following, the only necessity is that the first line of the page is the title of the page and is prefixed by '---+ ' (three hyphens, a plus and a space); when creating a new page this line is created for you. 

If you are encountering problems, please visit our {enhancements} page to determine if the problem has already been identified.

For guidance on using the many features, please see below:
