### Introduction

Headings are the most important formatting that your page will contain. Headings give your page a structure and enables the table of contents to work properly. Every page must start with a level 1 heading, as this is used to label the menu button.

All headings can be referenced anywhere in your page simply by typing the heading, thus typing see Introduction creates a link to this section.

### Usage

Simply start your line with three hyphens, followed by a number of plus-signs equivalent to the heading level. Thus a level 2 heading (the most common form) is activated by typing '---++ ' at the beginning of the line.

#### Heading 1

This is generally reserved for your page heading and the first Heading 1 is also used to label the page's menu button. Because the first Heading 1 is used to label the page's button, it is sometimes convenient to include a second Heading 1 with a fuller page name, located after the table of contents (if your page is using one).

<pre>
 ---+ Short name

 %TOC%

 ---+ Full page title
</pre>

#### Heading 2

You will use more Heading 2's than any other heading type. Depending on your site's style, you will probably have a style that includes a horizontal rule or stripe across the page, helping to visually break your page into manageable sections. Heading 2's also generate a ^top link, enabling your visitor to quickly return to the top of the page. Heading 2's are included in your table of contents.

<pre>
 ---++ Section or topic heading
</pre>

#### Heading 3

These are your sub-headings. For each Heading 2 you may choose to have several Heading 3's. These are, in effect, your minor headings. Heading 3's (and below) generally have little style, but serve to break each section into bite-sized chunks. Too many Heading 3's can start to clutter your page and even confuse your visitors. Use when necessary, but avoid over-use! Heading 3's are included in your table of contents; overuse can result in overly long table of contents.

<pre>
 ---+++ Minor point heading
</pre>

#### Headings 4, 5 and 6

A recent introduction, these are your sub-sub-headings, sub-sub-sub-headings, and sub-sub-sub-sub-headings. As such they can be confusing to visitors to your website. In general IMHO these heading levels are best avoided; however even we have been known to use them in exceptional circumstances! These heading levels are not included in your table of contents.

<pre>
 ---++++ Very minor point heading

 ---+++++ Insignificant point heading

 ---++++++ So insignificant you have to wonder whether it really warrants a heading at all!
