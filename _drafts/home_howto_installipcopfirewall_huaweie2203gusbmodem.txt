---++ Warning

These are my own personal notes, they relate to a UK Vodafone install, you would need to alter instructions for your location and telco.

---++ Introduction

Following a failure of our Internet connection, I hastily cobbled together a new proxy server using my 3G modem.  The reason I did not simply add the modem to our existing IPCop solution, was because IPCop currently only supports a single Red/WAN interface.  The IPCop FAQs specifically warn against attempting multiple interfaces.

There were many instructions on the Internet, but in reality it proved to be quite straightforward.  I followed these instructions, varying them slightly for Vodafone:

This was tested on IPCOP version 1.4.18, older versions may not work.

---++ Configure Kernel modules

When building your IPCOP, you need to set the IPCOP to use a network adaptor for the Green Interface and a Modem to use as the Red Interface.

From the command prompt logged on as root on the IPCOP you need to edit the /etc/modules.conf file.

<pre>
# nano /etc/modules.conf
</pre>

Add the following lines at the bottom:

<pre>
alias char-major-188 usbserial
options usbserial vendor=0x12d1 product=0x1003 maxSize=4096
</pre>

Then save the file and access (Press CTRL + O and press enter then press CTRL + X).

---++ Web Console - Modem

Log onto the web console and choose the Network menu and Modems.  Change INIT to:

<pre>
AT+CGDCONT=16,"IP","internet"
</pre>

---++ Web Console - Dial-up

Now select Dial-Up.

<pre>
Interface = "Modem on USB0"
Enter Number = "*99#"
Username = internet
Password = internet
Authentication method = PAP
DNS = Automatic
Profile name = Vodafone
</pre>

Press [Save].

---++ Test

Connect your 3G modem into the IPCOP box and reboot.

You should now be able to connect to the net using your 3G dongle.
