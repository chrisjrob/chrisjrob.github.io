### Method

Simply type your table row by row, separating each column with a pipe symbol '&#124;'. Attach an exclamation mark to the front of any header cell.
<pre>
&#124; !Fruit     &#124;  !Taste    &#124; !Price &#124;
&#124; Apple      &#124;  Sweet     &#124;   30p  &#124;
&#124; Lemon      &#124;  Bitter    &#124;   25p  &#124;
</pre>

<?> It is a good idea to line up your columns by padding with spaces (as shown), although this is not necessary, it does make reading the table in edit-mode easier.

|   !Fruit   |   !Taste   | !Price |
|   Apple    |   Sweet    |   30p  |
|   Lemon    |   Bitter   |   25p  |

To align the text within the column, simply position the text between the &#124;'s to suit, e.g.:

<pre>
&#124;   Fruit   &#124; <= centred
&#124;Apple      &#124; <= left aligned
&#124;      Lemon&#124; <= right aligned
</pre>

If you wish to paste in a table, for example from Excel, or from a Kerridge Adhoc or Report, then this should also work. Simply copy the table in the normal way and paste into the webpage.
