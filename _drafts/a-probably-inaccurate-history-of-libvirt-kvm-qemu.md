In the beginning there was QEMU, but it was slow and the people grieved.

Then KVM was forked from QEMU with a kernel module to use the CPU's
virtualisation features to work much faster and there was much
rejoicing. Linus also rejoiced and welcomed KVM's kernel module into
the mainline kernel.

But the people did not rejoice, as they were mostly using Sun's
VirtualBox (also forked from QEMU).

QEMU awoke from its slumber and joined with KVM and their union caused
almost no rejoicing, in fact I am not convinced anyone really noticed.

But the System Administrators were still dissatisfied and complained
that there should be standardisation of commands across different
hypervisors. And thus LibVirt was born and the System Administrators
rejoiced.

Yet still the people used VirtualBox. But lo! The evil Oracle slew the
Sun and VirtualBox moved into darkness, and there was much gnashing of
teeth and wearing of sackcloth; although this was generally considered
a step forwards from the t-shirts generally worn by geeks.

But still the people could not use QEMU-KVM, without issuing complex
incantations, and so Virt-Manager was born and finally the people
rejoiced, with much clicking of mice.

The End.
