## Cannot play DVDs

### The Issue

Sometimes we have DVDs that we would like to be able to play; but even if the relevant software was available, then it would be technically rendered unworkable, by the need to transmit the moving picture between client and server.

Question: would it be possible to install as a client application?

Question: is DVD software available for Debian?

The following was copied from http://www.itais.net/help/en/admin.html:

"Since most of the commercial DVDs these days are encrypted, in order to broadcast a DVD from the teacher computer, the libdvdcss2 package must be installed. A Debian package for it can be downloaded from http://ftp.debian-unofficial.org/debian/pool/main/libd/libdvdcss/ and installed using dpkg -i package.deb"
