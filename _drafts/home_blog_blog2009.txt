---++ 16/10/2009: Installing Nagios on Debian Lenny

Turns out this is as simple as:

%RAW%
<pre>
$ sudo -i
# apt-get install nagios3
# cd /etc/nagios3
# htpasswd -c htpasswd.users nagiosadmin
</pre>
%RAW%

Then point your browser at http://localhost/nagios3/

---++ 15/10/2009: Optimise Firefox

Apparently firefox uses sqlite for its databases, maintaining several *.sqlite files in your .mozilla/ profile directory.  Over time these become cluttered and it helps if you vacuum it:

%RAW%
<pre>
$ sudo apt-get install sqlite3
$ cd ~
$ find .mozilla/ -iname '*'.sqlite -exec sqlite3 "{}" VACUUM \;
</pre>
%RAW%

---++ 09/10/2009: DD over SSH

Wow, can't believe my last post was 4 months ago, well a quick tip to get me back into the blogging frame of mind.  If you wish to take a drive image copy over the network, then apparently you do not have to have an nfs share available.  Instead you can use ssh as follows:

%RAW%
<pre>
$ dd if=/dev/sda bs=1M | ssh root@blah "cat > /root/disk.img"
</pre>
%RAW%

Haven't tried it yet, but it sounds incredible.  The bs=1M is essential or the copy will take forever.

---++ 09/06/2009: May the source be with you

From time to time I see the comment advocating a closed source program, with the response "as I'm not a developer it doesn't bother me whether or not I have the source code".   I believe that that view is wrong, and that there are many occasions where non-developers will find benefit from having access to the source code.

For example,I've just found that Kmail will not autocomplete email addresses from an LDAP KDE resource.  A simple bug[1]; although strictly speaking it's not a bug, as it was a deliberate feature.  Fortunately there is a fix,  with a modification made to one of the components [2].  Unfortunately this fix has not found its way into Debian Lenny or Squeeze, and Sid is now KDE4. 

I could install from the KDE SVN repository, but that version has not been tested with Debian, and I don't really want to have such a significant part of a production server to have come from outside of Debian.  Perhaps I am being overly cautious.

Anyway, I changed to /usr/src and ran "apt-get source kdepim" to download the source from Debian.  I used "find" to locate the offending component, and used diff to determine what differences there were between the modified KDE version and the standard Debian version.  I was pleased to note that only one line had changed.  I copied in the new component and ran "apt-get build-dep kdepim" (with help from Dominic in #surrey).   Then a quick "./configure", a very slow "make", and a quick "sudo checkinstall make install" and the fix was made.

There are many many more benefits to open source than the ability to modify the source, but I just wanted to point out that, even for non-developers, there is a very real and very direct benefit to having the source.

May the source be with you.

---++ 27/05/2009: Building a new mailserver

Our Debian Lenny LTSP5 Install has hit a road block: currently the site are using a Citrix server at another location over a 256k connection to pick up their emails.  I really didn't feel that I could ask them all to collect their emails over a 256k connection, so what are the alternatives?  Well I could upgrade the bandwidth by creating an inter-site VPN, but that will still only provide perhaps 600k (that being the upload bandwidth of the host site).  The solution is to move the mailserver onto the 'net, so that they can benefit from a full 8mb ADSL download.

After seeking advice, I choose Bytemark as a trusted Debian VPS supplier, a day later I had my login to my new virtual server.  But what to install?  Advice pointed me in the direction of Postfix and Dovecot, which were not much more than an apt-get install:

   * http://www.debianadmin.com/debian-mail-server-setup-with-postfix-dovecot-sasl-squirrel-mail.html

Great, a working mailserver, but the problem with the installation was that the users were local system accounts, which made it more cumbersome to administer.  The best solution seemed to be LDAP, and I duly followed the guide {Debuntu|http://www.debuntu.org/ldap-server-and-linux-ldap-clients} to install, and I managed to integrate LDAP with PAM thus giving me the ability to allow users to login with an LDAP account; but in a nutshell that was exactly what was wrong with this solution - the users *had* to login to the server, before their system account would be created, and if that was the case I might as well have stuck with local system accounts in the first place.  What I needed was a true virtual mail host.  To that end, I was pointed in the direction of a Ubuntu howto on Howtoforge:

   * http://www.howtoforge.com/postfix-virtual-hosting-with-ldap-and-dovecot-on-ubuntu8.04

Okay but this was for Ubuntu not Debian and for one reason and another I simply could not get it working.  After starting from scratch a couple of times, but ending up in the same place, I found that I had to combine the howto with this one for 8.10:

   * http://www.howtoforge.com/postfix-virtual-hosting-with-ldap-backend-and-with-dovecot-pop3-imap-on-ubuntu-8.10

Even then it took a fair amount of battling to get it working on Debian Lenny.  The key to most of my problems was in reading the comments on every page, as these include invaluable corrections and suggestions.

So after a week of pain, I now have a working virtual mail host, now I just need to set-up the domains, users and mailgroups.

---++ 14/04/2009: Improving boot performance

One thing you need to know about me is that I am rarely satisfied.  For example, my laptop boots up in a very acceptable 25 seconds, but still I am looking for better.  So far I have not managed to improve matters, but I did find a great tool for graphing your boot performance, and a very neat way of adding it as a grub boot option, read the following article for how to set this up:

---++ 11/04/2009: Surrey LUG Bring-a-Box Meeting

I've just returned from my first Bring-a-Box meeting at Nokia in Farnborough.  I found it hugely enjoyable to have people who actually want to talk about Linux.

I was introduced to Firestarter, which is a GUI to configure a firewall and share your Internet connection, if you so wish, I'm looking forward to having a play with this.

---++ 22/03/2009: A warm fuzzy feeling

I apologise in advance for this shameless piece of self-congratulation; but a while ago I wrote about how to Recover Data from a Hard Disk, and I published it also on my local LUG's knowledgebase.  I have received an email to say that my instructions have enabled someone to recover two years' worth of lesson plans for a special-needs teacher.  So I must admit to feeling rather pleased with myself!

---++ 14/03/2009: MythWeb

If, like me, you have your laptop permanently on whilst you watch TV, then MythWeb is going to be a shock, a delightful shock.  Imagine, from the comfort of your sofa, with your laptop on your lap:

   * What's on TV?  Open your browser and you have a beautifully formatted programme guide - far better than an on-TV guide.
   * Want to record something? Simply click on it, choose your options and submit
   * Nothing on TV?  View your Recorded Programmes
   * Want to know what you've got set to record?  Upcoming Recordings
   * On holiday and you realise you forgot to record the new series of Doctor Who?  Log-into MythWeb remotely and record.
   * At work and you want to show your colleagues the funny bit in Big Bang Theory?  No problem log into MythWeb and download, or play the episode in Flash

And there's more: weather, ripped video, music, and more.  If you're anything like me, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it, and quite simply it has now spoiled me for ANY other PVR system.

---++ 12/03/2009: LTSP5 Progress

After a week spent trying to install our Debian Lenny LTSP server, with the clients failing to boot with an error "rpc failed: 2", and everyone I spoke to baffled as to how this could occur, I decided that enough was enough, and deleted the partitions and started again.  Within 2 hours the server was back up and running without any of the same problems.

And a lesson learned: don't invest too much time in an install, without testing that the fundamentals are in place!

---++ 10/03/2009: Mythbuntu

Initial impressions weren't that great, but I have to say mythtv is winning us over.  The turning point was when we switched on mythweb.  Mythweb does several things, but most notably it provides the program listings in a much more usable format than via mythtv  This makes it must easier to browse and search the listings and record programs.  And with a little extra work, it should be possible to make this accessible over the web.  This feature gained huge spouse approval.

The other win is the commercial skipping, enabling a one button press to skip adverts.

---++ 01/03/2009: Mythbuntu

I finally obliterated Microsoft Windows XP Mediocre Centre from our living room.  I know one shouldn't indulge in Microsoft bashing, but I have earned the right after suffering with that atrocious system for the past five years.  I would go so far as to say that my experience with that machine over the past five years is the number one reason I use Linux on the desktop today.

Anyway, decided to replace it with Mythbuntu, because (1) it's Debian based, (2) it should provide a quicker install than Debian.

My first impressions are that, if Ubuntu is Linux for human beings, Mythbuntu is Linux for human beings who have evolved into a higher form of intelligence.

The problem is that it's trying to do so much, that the essential options are obscured by the trivial; they really should triage the options into essential (need this to get a working television), important (you need this, but not necessarily immediately), and the rest.

Also, it simply isn't intuitive enough, for example I now understand that you have to install the capture cards, then the video sources (bizarrely this is the channel/guide information - or at least I think so) and then, after four hours of hair tearing I finally realised that you also have to configure the next option on the list "Input connections" which effectively links the tuners to the channel/guide information.  If they must call the channel/guide information "Video sources", then they could at least have the decency to call the "Input connections" option something like "Connect Capture Cards to Video Sources", which I would have immediately understood (at least once I had worked out what the heck Video Sources were).

All very frustrating, and I really have been made to feel like an innocent newbie all over again.  Horrible.

But I can see that, once I'm over this hump, it will do just about everything I could possibly ever want, and a great deal more besides.  And it looks good, which is important in a living room computer.

And most importantly, we are a Microsoft-free house - hurrah!
