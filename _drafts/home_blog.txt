---++ 23/02/2011: Moving to Wordpress

I've decided to move to a proper blogging platform, rather than continue to use my home grown solution.  Please update your feed reader to:

   * http://chrisjrob.wordpress.com/feed/

I did consider setting up my own Wordpress server, but rightly or wrongly I decided to save myself the effort, time will tell whether that was the right decision or not!

---++ 17/02/2011: HP Proliant DL360G5 / DL380G5 Temperature Monitoring

I don't have the HP Management suite installed on my HP Proliant servers, largely because they proved to be a huge resource hog, but I would like to be able to monitor stuff.  On PCs I am used to being able to use lm-sensors, so thought I'd give that a go.  Installing it prompted me to install ipmitool, which in turn needs openipmi.

%RAW%
<pre>
# apt-get install lm-sensors openipmi ipmitool
</pre>
%RAW%

Then I ran the standard sensors-detect command, accepting YES for all options (I was feeling quite brave):

%RAW%
<pre>
# sensors-detect
</pre>
%RAW%

This ended up writing the following into /etc/modules:

%RAW%
<pre>
# Generated by sensors-detect on Thu Feb 17 18:04:48 2011
# You must also install and load the IPMI modules
ipmi-si
# Chip drivers
# Warning: the required module ipmisensors is not currently installed
# on your system. For status of 2.6 kernel ports check
# http://www.lm-sensors.org/wiki/Devices. If driver is built
# into the kernel, or unavailable, comment out the following line.
ipmisensors

# no driver for SMSC SCH4307 Super IO Fan Sensors yet
coretemp
</pre>
%RAW%

To test this without rebooting I typed the commands in succession, but found that ipmisensors did not exist, some googling suggested the module to be "ipmi_devintf", and that indeed seemed to work:

%RAW%
<pre>
# modprobe ipmi-si
# modprobe ipmi_devintf
# modprobe coretemp
</pre>
%RAW%

So the additions to my /etc/modules now looked like this:

%RAW%
<pre>
# Generated by sensors-detect on Thu Feb 17 18:04:48 2011
# You must also install and load the IPMI modules
ipmi-si
# Chip drivers
# Warning: the required module ipmisensors is not currently installed
# on your system. For status of 2.6 kernel ports check
# http://www.lm-sensors.org/wiki/Devices. If driver is built
# into the kernel, or unavailable, comment out the following line.
# ipmisensors
ipmi_devintf

# no driver for SMSC SCH4307 Super IO Fan Sensors yet
coretemp
</pre>
%RAW%

And then I tested the commands with:

%RAW%
<pre>
# sensors
# ipmitool sensors
</pre>
%RAW%

Both of which commands brought back sensible information.  Now I just need to work out how to incorporate this into nagios with nrpe, but that can wait for another day.

---++ 07/02/2011: Etherpad on Debian Squeeze

Just installed Etherpad on our openvz server.  Having created an openvz guest for the purpose, running Debian Squeeze, installing Etherpad proved no more difficult than adding the Etherpad repository to your /etc/apt/sources.list:

%RAW%
<pre>
$ sudo su
# echo "deb http://apt.etherpad.org all ." &gt;&gt; /etc/apt/sources.list
# apt-get update
# apt-get install etherpad
</pre>
%RAW%

All the requisite dependencies were brought in.  Unfortunately the etherpad server did not start after installation, and I had to do the following commands:

%RAW%
<pre>
# sed -i.orig 's/local/share/' /etc/init.d/etherpad
</pre>
%RAW%

Then it started perfectly simply with /etc/init.d/etherpad start.

To make this happen automatically on boot:

%RAW%
<pre>
# update-rc.d etherpad defaults
</pre>
%RAW%

If you would prefer to use openjdk than sun-java (and you should), then google for "etherpad openjdk".  Sorry to say I was in too much of a hurry on this occasion.

---++ 05/12/2010: Skype 64-bit

When I bought my Toshiba laptop and opted for 64-bit Debian Squeeze I made one compromise, I gave up Skype.  This was for the simple reason that it would not work on 64-bit Linux (or 64-bit anything, come to that).  Later I heard from several people that you could install the 32-bit version using the 32-bit libraries, but I was conscious that this was sub-optimal and in any case Skype should be punished for being closed source and, perhaps more to the point, for not providing a 64-bit version.

Skype is important, though, for new Linux users.  It is no good telling them to use SIP, as their friends have Skype and most people do not want to make the sacrifices that some of us feel are necessary.

Feeling a little guilty, I decided to give it a go.  I was expecting to download the 32-bit version of Skype, and the 32-bit libraries, but was surprised to see a 64-bit version for Ubuntu.  Given that Ubuntu is based on Debian, it was worth a try.

   * http://www.skype.com/intl/en-gb/get-skype/on-your-computer/linux/post-download/

I installed it with:

%RAW%
<pre>
$ sudo dpkg -i skype-ubuntu-intrepid_2.1.0.81-1_amd64.deb
</pre>
%RAW%

And, erm, it seems to work.  Well at least the test call worked perfectly.

So we seem to be able to tick the Skype 64-bit box as "job done", now how about iTunes...

A while ago I wrote:

For some reason it is not saving a bookmark when you stop watching a recorded program in the middle, so that you have to find where you were manually. This worked fine on our old machine, so just need to find out what is wrong. I can research this when I have time.

Well I am delighted to say that this was fixed by an option in the Playing TV settings for saving bookmarks.

---++ 15/11/2010: Why building your own PC still makes sense

Which such cheap PCs now available, does it really make sense to build your own?  I think so, and these are the reasons why:

Despite the cheap PCs, there are still some direct savings to be made, obviously Linux users can save the Microsoft licence, but there are other savings too.  For example you can re-use components from your existing PC, this might be a short-term way of you getting the PC that you want, and then replacing the components over time.

Already have a keyboard, mouse and DVD/RW?  Reuse them - it's more environmentally friendly and, if they fail later, then you can always replace them and thus stagger the cost.  Why not plan to re-use your existing hard-drive, perhaps as a second drive or as a back-up drive, it'll make it easier to transfer data.  If you're trying to save money then you could build your PC using on-board graphics and then plan to buy a decent graphics card at a later stage.

Another advantage to building your own PC is that you get to choose the compromises that are made.  The cheapest components are incredibly cheap, so for example if you were planning to keep the base unit behind the sofa, then you could specify a £15 case, instead of a £100 case.

You also get to specify things like RAM - we've all gone to upgrade PCs, only to find that both slots have already been used - now you can make sure that you buy a single 2gb RAM with the knowledge that you can buy a second when you have more money.

It is this type of flexibility which still makes building your own compelling.

It is true that it takes longer to build your own, but I find the bulk of the time taken is in choosing the components, the build itself is usually no more than an hour, and I probably waste three hours in agonising over the purchase of the components!  The only thing that is tricky is in deciding which way around the different connectors go, but generally the booklets that come with the motherboard are very helpful, and failing that the Internet is a wonderful resource.

The ability to repair the device is I find not so much down to your experience of the build, but in your confidence that all the components are standard off-the-shelf items.  If you suspect that the graphics card is shot, then, buying a replacement is easy, because you know exactly what you need.

I tend to choose the CPU, then knowing the CPU I purchase a compatible motherboard, from there it is pretty simple to choose the case to fit the motherboard, and the rest of the items should be straightforward.  PSU obviously needs to be sensitive to the case, but if you have gone for a standard ATX case, that should not be an issue.

Alternatively https://www.lambda-tek.com/ have a PC Designer to do this for you, I have not used it myself yet, but it looks impressive.

If you want a small form factor device than visit http://linitx.com, who have knowledgeable people on the end of the phone to advise you.

---++ 28/10/2010: A quick and dirty install of LibreOffice on Debian

Following the forking of OpenOffice.org into LibreOffice under the auspices of the new Document Foundation, I decided that I should take a look.

First I removed OpenOffice:

%RAW%
<pre>
$ sudo apt-get --purge remove ".*openoffice.*"
</pre>
%RAW%

Then I visited:

   * http://download.documentfoundation.org/libreoffice/testing/

Downloading:

   * LibO_3.3.0_beta2_Linux_x86_install-deb_en-US.tar.gz
   * LibO_3.3.0_beta2_Linux_x86_langpack-deb_en-GB.tar.gz

Then, having checked that the md5sums matched, I extracted both with "tar -xvvzf" and changed to the DEBS directory in each and ran:

%RAW%
<pre>
$ sudo dpkg -i *.deb
</pre>
%RAW%

All very clumsy, but this was only my work PC, which isn't mission critical, as I generally use NX client to log into my desktop on our LTSP Server.

So what are my first impressions?  Sadly these will have to wait for another day, apart from the obvious branding change, I couldn't see much different, but the good news is that it does all appear to be working.

I am not sure whether LibreOffice yet has the http://go-oo.org patches, which I believe were included by default in Debian and Ubuntu, but the fact that they are being combined into the core must be good news.  I am really hoping that LibreOffice improves quickly on OpenOffice, which still falls considerably short of Microsoft Office for power users.  In particular Macros, Pivot Tables, Conditional Formatting, and Mailmerge all need a lot of work.  Not to speak of the appalling performance, it really is a system hog.  I can't help feeling that it really needs to be re-written from scratch, but I appreciate that is unrealistic.  In the meantime I have hopes that KOffice will soon step up to the mark - KWord's mailmerge feature is a lesson in simplicity that OpenOffice/LibreOffice would do well to learn.

---++ 18/10/2010: Installing Ruby on Rails

I need a way of creating some quick and dirty web apps for internal use.  To this end, I decided to give Ruby on Rails a try.  Unfortunately it is in heavy development and the Debian packages have not kept up.  I decided to try and install from source, and, after several blind alleys, I ended up with quite a simple installation...

   * {Install Ruby on Rails3 on Debian Lenny}

---++ 14/10/2010: Home Theatre PC - Continued

A quick post regarding the issue of myth-backend having to be restarted on every boot, this was easily fixed simply by editing the upstart configuration /etc/init/myth-backend.conf and adding "and udev" to the "start on" line.  Now Myth comes up correctly first time every time!
