---++ 23/07/2008: Konica Minolta C250 Printing Problems

Since making the transition to Linux we have been unable to print reliably to our Konica Minolta C250 colour photocopier.  Basically only simple print jobs will print, more complicated print jobs never come through, the data light flashes indefinitely and the photocopier needs to be rebooted.  In particular we have problems printing PDFs and wep-pages in Iceweasel. Web-pages in Konqueror seem okay, which makes you think that the problem is with the non-KDE applications, but the PDFs that won't print from Acrobat Reader, also won't print from KPDF.

You can follow my progress on the Konica Minolta C250 Printing Problems page.

The ability to print in colour is important to us, and the fact that as I roll-out Linux, each user loses the ability to print in colour, is not good.  Hopefully I will have more success tomorrow.
