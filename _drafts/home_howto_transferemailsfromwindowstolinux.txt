---++ Introduction

These instructions explain how to transfer emails from a Windows email client to Linux Kmail.  This document has a number of provisos:

   # If your mailserver is running IMAP, then what are you doing here?  Just connect your Linux mail client to your IMAP server and you're good to go!
   # If you are running a common mail client on Windows, then consider installing Mozilla Thunderbird on Windows and importing your emails into that...
      # See specific notes on Microsoft Outlook
   # If you are running Mozilla Thunderbird on Windows, then you can simply copy the files onto Linux and use Mozilla Thunderbird on Linux - job done.
   # If your Windows email client stores in mbox format (unlikely) then again you should be able to simply copy the mail store to Linux.
   # Check whether you have any export options and see if you can export into an easier format, e.g. Thunderbird/MBOX.
   # If your Windows email client does not support IMAP, then you will need to upgrade it to a more recent version that does before proceeding.
   # If your Windows email client does support IMAP, then let's continue...

---++ Install Courier-IMAP on server

See Install Courier-IMAP Server.

---++ Create LTSP User

In KUserManager create the user, and add to the following groups:

   * kiosk-standard
   * Staff
   * Users
   * Fuse (only if you want them to be able to access USB devices)
   * Saned (only if you want them to be able to use scanning)

<?> Take a note of UID and GID before exiting KUserManager

---++ Create IMAP Account

<!> You need to have installed an IMAP server first - see page Install Courier-IMAP Server

<pre>
$ sudo userdb USERNAME set uid=9999 gid=9999 shell=/bin/bash home=/opt/imap-mail/USERNAME
</pre>
*Replace USERNAME and 9999 for actual username, uid and gid

<pre>
$ sudo userdbpw -md5 | sudo userdb USERNAME set systempw
$ sudo mkdir -p /opt/imap-mail/USERNAME
$ sudo maildirmake /opt/imap-mail/USERNAME/Maildir
$ sudo chown -R 9999:9999 /opt/imap-mail/USERNAME
$ sudo makeuserdb
$ sudo /etc/init.d/courier-authdaemon stop
$ sudo /etc/init.d/courier-imap stop
$ sudo /etc/init.d/courier-authdaemon start
$ sudo /etc/init.d/courier-imap start
</pre>
*Replace USERNAME and 9999 for actual username, uid and gid

---++ Key steps

The rest of the process is simple enough, that hopefully I do not need to go through it in detail.  Briefly:

   * Install Courier-IMAP Server
   * Create IMAP account in Windows email client
   * Log onto LTSP
   * Kontact >> Mail >> Create IMAP account
   * Transfer each mail folder into IMAP Inbox then transfer each IMAP folder into Kmail folder
   * Repeat last step for each folder

<?> Change each client to work off-line between transfers - you don't really want both clients connected to the same IMAP mailbox at the same time
