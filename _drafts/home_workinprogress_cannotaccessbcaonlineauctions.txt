Call has been logged with BCA as ref 199445:

   # From internet Explorer select Tools >> Internet Options >> Security then select the Internet Icon and then click the custom level button.
   # Towards the bottom of the list should be a section labelled scripting of Java applets.
   # Set this to enabled then click OK and OK.

As the screen shots suggest they need to check their Internet options-security-java applet/activex settings. If they are coming thro a company firewall or network they may not be able to reset these settings.
