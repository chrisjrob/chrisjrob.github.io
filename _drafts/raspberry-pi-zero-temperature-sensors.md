RASPBERRY PI ZERO W TEMPERATURE SENSORS
=======================================

Instructions
------------

Downloaded [Raspbian Jessie Lite]. 
Configured for [headless setup] and [how to set up wifi on raspbian jessie lite].
Followed instructions for [temp probe exporter], to modify config and principal.
Then followed [One Wire Digital Temperature Sensor] for a single sensor.
Then followed [OneWire temperature sensor DS18B20] to add a second sensor.
Then I returned to [temp probe exporter] for how to talk to sensor.
