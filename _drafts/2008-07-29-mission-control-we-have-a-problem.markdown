---++ 29/07/2008: Mission Control - We have a Problem

Our ADSL connection went down yesterday morning, taking with it our websites, email and browsing.  It is amazing how cut-off you feel without Internet access.  We have a fully-managed service, so Clara.net sent out a replacement router, only to find that the problem was elsewhere and that they had to log the fault with BT.

Thinking that our Internet access could be out for days, I decided to try and utilise my laptop's Vodafone 3G modem.  After a little research on my Eee PC I discovered that IPCop firewall can only handle a single WAN interface, so I decided to build a temporary IPCop firewall for the purpose:

   * Install IPCop Firewall
      * Huawei E220 3G USB Modem

Amazingly it only took a couple of hours, including building a new PC, and it worked beautifully.  Unfortunately, or perhaps that's fortunately, no-one will ever know how good it was, because our Internet connection started working again about 15-minutes after I had completed it!
