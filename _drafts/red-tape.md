# Why we will never be rid of red tape

Over the last few weeks I have been working to improve our company handbook. 
I found it a very interesting example of 'red tape' and why we will never be rid of it.

1. Disciplinary and Grievance Policy

Required to comply with current law and ACAS Code of Practice. 
It is difficult to argue with a case for having a clear disciplinary policy, but dealing with staff grievances fairly is also important.

2. Equal Opportunities

There is a legal requirement for an equal opportunities policy to comply with the Equality Act 2010. 
Our work equal opportunities policy was massively outdated and largely concentrated on gender. 
Few people these days would argue against equal opportunities for all.

3. Bullying & Harassment Policy

Employers have a legal responsibility to prevent bullying and harassment in the workplace. 
A formal policy goes some way to achieving this; although of course it needs to be enforced. 
Again few would argue with the importance of ensuring that there is not bullying and harassment in the workplace.

4. Data Protection Policy

Undoubtedly considered by many to be 'red tape', the arrival of the Internet age, spam, phishing and privacy concerns all mean that suddenly data protection is an important issue. 

5. Health & Safety Policy

Undoubtedly this is a key area where 'red tape' has entered our business. 
The reason for all this mass of red tape - peoples' lives are important. 
Everyone has the right to work in a workplace that is safe. 
You might feel that going up a ladder to fix your gutter is an acceptable risk, but it is very difficult for an employer to consider any risk for their staff as being acceptable.
If you have a pothole in the customer car park and you ignore it, and an elderly customer trips and spends the next month in hospital - is that acceptable?
Clearly safety is important, so let's move on.

6. Expenses Policy

HMRC require us to have a defined expenses policy, so that they can ensure that there are not taxable benefits being gained by staff and that the correct VAT is being handled. 
It doesn't seem to crazy that we should define our policy of expenses, except that we have so few each month that it does appear to be grossly out of proportion to the problem.

7. Anti-Bribery & Corruption Policy, Anti-Money Laundering Policy

I'll tackle these two items together, given that they are related. 
It is

Whistleblowing Policy
Substance, Alcohol & Drugs Abuse Policy
PCI DSS Policy
FCA Manual
Quality Manual

Electrical testing
