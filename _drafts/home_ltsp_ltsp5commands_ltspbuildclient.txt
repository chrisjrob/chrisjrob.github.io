---+ ltsp-build-client

---++ Introduction

The ltsp-build-client command will download a complete Debian filesystem into /opt/ltsp/i386 (or specify an alternate location with "--base") and install the ltsp-client and ldm (LTSP Display Manager) packages.  As such, you will probably only run this command the first time you install LTSP5.

You should move /opt/ltsp to /opt/ltsp_old before you start.

You should see the man page appropriate for your system, but the Debian Lenny man page current states:

NAME
       ltsp-build-client - Builds an LTSP client system for use with the LTSP server

SYNOPSIS
       ltsp-build-client  <options>

DESCRIPTION
       ltsp-build-client  builds  an  ltsp client chroot using standard packages for use with the ltsp server.  This chroot installation  can be modified in a number of ways as outlined in the OPTIONS section.  If present, defaults
       will be read from the configuration file /etc/ltsp/ltsp-build-client.conf, and will be overridden by using the command line options. ltsp-build-client is usually run as the root  user.   Visit  http://www.ltsp.org  for  more
       information.

OPTIONS
       Not all options are available on all installations. For a complete list of available options, use the --help and --extra-help options.

       --arch arch
                 Builds a chroot with the specified architecture. Must be a supported architecture of the distribution, and compatible with the host architecture.  Defaults vary by distribution.

       --base dir
                 Sets the default path for the ltsp chroots to be installed into. Defaults to /opt/ltsp/.

       --chroot file
                 Sets the default name for the ltsp chroot. Defaults to the architecture selected with --arch or the running architecture.

       --conf file
                 Load configuration defaults from specified file. See CONFIG FILE below for more information.

       --dist distribution
                 Distribution : Sets the distribution to be installed in the client chroot.  Defaults to the running distribution.

       --extra-help
                 Displays all available commandline options.

       --help    Displays the ltsp-build-client help message.

                 Select the mirror to download packages from. file:/// and http:// URLs are supported.

CONFIG FILE
       ltsp-build-client will read a configuration file to override built-in defaults. the default location for this configuration file is /etc/ltsp/ltsp-build-client.conf, and can be specified with the --conf commandline option.

       values are NAME="VALUE" pairs, with # representing commented lines. most commandline options have an equivalent. an example Debian based system with an alternate base location, architecture, and distribution:

        # set alternate default location for ltsp chroot (--base)
        BASE="/srv/ltsp"
        # build an amd64 chroot by default (--arch)
        ARCH="amd64"
        # build a Debian sid environment (--dist)
        DIST="sid"
