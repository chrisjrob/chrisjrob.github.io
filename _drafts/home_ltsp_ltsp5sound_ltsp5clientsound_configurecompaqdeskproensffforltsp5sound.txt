---+ Configure Compaq Deskpro ENSFF for LTSP5 Sound

---++ Introduction

We have a number of Compaq Deskpro EN-SFF P450 PCs.  These are small-form-factor Pentium IIIs with Compaq quality.  I believe these have the ESS1869 soundcard.

<!> The BIOS settings on our PCs are io=0x220 irq=5 dma=1 dma16=5; your settings may be different!

---++ LTSP4.2

They worked flawlessly under LTSP4.2 with the following LTS.conf configuration:

<pre>
SMODULE_01         = "snd-es18xx irq=5"
</pre>

Since upgrading to LTSP5, sound has ceased to function.

---++ Testing

I booted the client and typed [Ctrl]+[Alt]+[F1] to bring up the client console and typed:

<pre>
# lsmod | grep snd
</pre>

Which returned nothing, showing that sound was definitely not loaded (no surprise there!).

Next I tried typing:

<pre>
# modprobe snd-es18xx
ESS AudioDrive ES18xx soundcard not found or device busy
FATAL: Error inserting snd_es18xx (/lib/modules/2.6.18-6-486/kernel/sound/isa/snd-es18xx.ko): No such device
</pre>

---++ Research

Next I Googled "(ltsp5|edubuntu) snd-es18xx" which produced the following thread:

   * http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=148077

This was not specific to LTSP5, nevertheless it gave a useful configuration:

<pre>
/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base

alias char-major-116 snd
alias snd-card-0 snd-es18xx
options snd-es18xx index=0 enable=1 isapnp=0 port=0x220 mpu_port=0x388 fm_port=0x330 irq=5 dma1=1 dma2=0

alias char-major-14 soundcore
alias sound-slot-0 snd-card-0

alias sound-service-0-0 snd-mixer-oss
alias sound-service-0-1 snd-seq-oss
alias sound-service-0-3 snd-pcm-oss
alias sound-service-0-8 snd-seq-oss
alias sound-service-0-12 snd-pcm-oss
</pre>

In particular the following line looked useful:

<pre>
options snd-es18xx index=0 enable=1 isapnp=0 port=0x220 mpu_port=0x388 fm_port=0x330 irq=5 dma1=1 dma2=0
</pre>

Still in the client console I typed:

<pre>
# modprobe snd-es18xx index=0 enable=1 isapnp=0 port=0x220 mpu_port=0x388 fm_port=0x330 irq=5 dma1=1 dma2=0
#
</pre>

And the sound module loaded fine.  I then ran:

<pre>
# speaker-test
speaker-test 1.0.13
Playback device is default
Stream parameters are 48000Hz, S16_LE, 1 channels
Using 16 octaves of pink noise
...
</pre>

And sound was working fine.

---++ LTS.conf

So obviously all we need to do is to set in LTS.conf and we should be sorted:

<pre>
SMODULE_01         = "snd-es18xx index=0 enable=1 isapnp=0 port=0x220 mpu_port=0x388 fm_port=0x330 irq=5 dma1=1 dma2=0"
</pre>

But no joy!  Thinking that the issue was with an incompatibility with one of the above switches and LTSP, I experimented with removing all the switches and just adding some back; the aim being to end up with a minimal set of switches that worked.  On a hunch I tried:

<pre>
# modprobe snd-es18xx isapnp=0
</pre>

And the speaker-test worked.  Adding this to LTS.conf

<pre>
SMODULE_01         = "snd-es18xx isapnp=0"
</pre>

And it *still* didn't work.  For some reason, that I cannot find documented, SMODULE is no longer working, and needs replacing with MODULE - thus:

<pre>
MODULE_01         = "snd-es18xx isapnp=0"
</pre>

All now working.
